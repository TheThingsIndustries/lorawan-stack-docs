- term: Join Server
  description: A Join Server is a component of the LoRaWAN server defined in the LoRaWAN Backend Interfaces. The Things Stack contains a Join Server, which is used by default unless an External Join Server is specified. The Join Server's role is to store root keys, generate session keys, and to send those securely to the Network Server and Application Server of choice. The device contains the same root keys, which can be provisioned as part of assembly, distribution or upon installation. An External Join Server allows for secure end device provisioning without network lock-in. The owner uses a device claiming procedure to transfer ownership in the Join Server.

- term: Fixed Channel
  description: Fixed channels are predefined and fixed within the LoRaWAN protocol specification. They are used for both uplink and downlink communication. Devices and gateways must support fixed channels defined for their region to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. A Band which uses Fixed Channels (i.e. US902, AU915) uses a Channel Mask (ChMask) to enable and disable channels.

- term: Class B timeout
  description: Time duration after the last receive window during which the device remains in a listening state for possible downlinks sent from the Network Server. The Network Server waits for the uplink message with acknowledgment (for previously scheduled downlink) to arrive, or for this class B timeout to expire before scheduling next downlink message. This feature enhances responsiveness of Class B devices to downlinks compared to Class A devices. {{% tts %}} does not schedule MAC commands in class B downlink; the only type of downlink messages that require an uplink message within this timeout are confirmed application data downlink messages.

- term: Class C timeout
  description: Time after sending a class C confirmed downlink message to wait for an uplink message with acknowledgment that the confirmed downlink message was received. The Network Server waits for the uplink message with acknowledgment to arrive, or for this class C timeout to expire before scheduling other downlink messages. {{% tts %}} does not schedule MAC commands in class C downlink; the only type of downlink messages that require an uplink message within this timeout are confirmed application data downlink messages.

- term: Resets FCnt

OTAA devices receive the RX1 delay as part of the join-accept. Changing the desired value during an OTAA or ABP session makes the Network Server transmit the `RXTimingSetupReq` MAC command.

- term: RX1 data rate offset
  description: Used to lower data rate in the first receive window (RX1). When using 0, there is no offset applied. A value higher than 0 reduces the RX1 data rate. See LoRaWAN Regional Parameters to lookup the downstream data rate in RX1 for each offset value. OTAA devices receive the RX1 data rate offset as part of the join-accept. Changing the desired value during an OTAA or ABP session makes the Network Server transmit the `RXParamSetupReq` MAC command.

- term: RX2 data rate index
  description: The second receive window (RX2) uses a fixed frequency and data rate. This value configures the data rate to use in RX2. See LoRaWAN Regional Parameters to find the band's modulation settings for each data rate index. OTAA devices receive the RX1 data rate offset as part of the join-accept. Changing the desired value during an OTAA or ABP session makes the Network Server transmit the `RXParamSetupReq` MAC command.

- term: RX2 data rate frequency

The allowed time-on-air is 1/N where N is the given value, 1 is 100%, 1024 is 0.97%, etc. This value is used for traffic shaping. All end devices must respect regional regulations regardless of this value. Changing the desired value makes the Network Server transmit the `DutyCycleReq` MAC command.

- term: ADR ACK limit
  description: The ADR ACK limit (`ADR_ACK_LIMIT`) is a configurable parameter which is a part of the ADR back-off mechanism, that refers to the maximum number of attempts made by the Network Server to send an ACK as a response to an uplink from a device. Lowering the ADR ACK limit helps preventing excessive ACK retries that could potentially increase congestion. If device fails to receive ACK within the specified limit, the Network Server may adjust ADR parameters to improve reliability.

- term: ADR ACK delay
  description: The ADR ACK delay (`ADR_ACK_DELAY`) is a configurable parameter which is a part of the ADR back-off mechanism, that refers to the delay before sending an ACK as a response to an uplink from a device. A shorter ADR ACK delay allows quicker transmission confirmation, but may increase the likelihood of collisions in a high-traffic environment.

- term: Ping slot data rate index
  description: The class B ping slot uses a fixed frequency and data rate. This value configures the data rate to use in class B ping slots.

  description: The maximum allowed Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP). The end device uses this value as the maximum, it shall never use a higher EIRP, but a lower EIRP is allowed. This value is given in dBm. Changing the desired value makes the Network Server transmit the `TxParamSetupReq`.

- term: Received Signal Strength Indicator
  description: The received signal power in milliwatts, measured in dBm. This value is used as a measurement of how well the signal is received. RSSI is used in the ADR feedback loop to determine if a signal is being received with enough power to allow the device to increase its data rate and conserve battery. A high RSSI means the device can reduce transmission power and messages will still be received.
