- term: Tenant ID
  description: A Tenant ID is given to you by The Things Industries when you register for a Cloud account. Your Tenant ID is part of the URL of your deployment, i.e https://<tenant-id>.eu1.thethings.industries.

- term: Join Server
  description: A Join Server is a component of the LoRaWAN server defined in the LoRaWAN Backend Interfaces. The Things Stack contains a Join Server, which is used by default unless an External Join Server is specified. The Join Server's role is to store root keys, generate session keys, and to send those securely to the Network Server and Application Server of choice. The device contains the same root keys, which can be provisioned as part of assembly, distribution or upon installation. An External Join Server allows for secure end device provisioning without network lock-in. The owner uses a device claiming procedure to transfer ownership in the Join Server.

- term: Activation Mode
  description: "**Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA)** is the preferred and most secure way to connect a device. Devices perform a join-procedure with the network, during which a dynamic Device Address is assigned and security keys are negotiated with the device. **Activation by Personalization (ABP)** requires hardcoding the Device Address as well as the security keys in the device. This strategy might seem simpler, because you skip the join procedure, but it has downsides related to security. ABP also has the downside that devices can not switch network providers without manually changing keys in the device. **Multicast** is a virtual group of ABP devices which allows all devices to receive the same downlinks. Multicast groups do not support uplinks."

- term: Gateway

- term: Class A
  description: Class A devices support bi-directional communication between a device and a gateway. Uplink messages (from the device to the server) can be sent at any time (randomly).

The Things Stack does not schedule MAC commands in class B downlink; the only type of downlink messages that require an uplink message within this timeout are confirmed application data downlink messages.

- term: Class C timeout
  description: Time after sending a class C confirmed downlink message to wait for an uplink message with acknowledgment that the confirmed downlink message was received. The Network Server waits for the uplink message with acknowledgment to arrive or for this class C timeout to expire before scheduling other downlink messages. The Things Stack does not schedule MAC commands in class C downlink; the only type of downlink messages that require an uplink message within this timeout are confirmed application data downlink messages.

- term: ADR enabled
  description: Whether or not Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) is enabled for the end device to optimize the data rate and power consumption based on signal strength and noise ratio. Enable this for stationary end devices and for end devices that set the LoRaWAN ADR bit in uplink messages. If this setting is enabled, but the end device does not ask for ADR in uplink messages, ADR will not be applied. Disable ADR for moving devices like asset trackers.

- term: Resets FCnt

- term: RX1 data rate offset
  description: Used to lower data rate in the first receive window (RX1). When using 0, there is no offset applied. A value higher than 0 reduces the RX1 data rate. See LoRaWAN Regional Parameters to lookup the downstream data rate in RX1 for each offset value. OTAA devices receive the RX1 data rate offset as part of the join-accept. Changing the desired value during an OTAA or ABP session makes the Network Server transmit the `RXParamSetupReq` MAC command.

- term: RX2 data rate index
  description: The second receive window (RX2) uses a fixed frequency and data rate. This value configures the data rate to use in RX2. See LoRaWAN Regional Parameters to find the band's modulation settings for each data rate index. OTAA devices receive the RX1 data rate offset as part of the join-accept. Changing the desired value during an OTAA or ABP session makes the Network Server transmit the `RXParamSetupReq` MAC command.

- term: RX2 data rate frequency

The allowed time-on-air is 1/N where N is the given value, 1 is 100%, 1024 is 0.97%, etc. This value is used for traffic shaping. All end devices must respect regional regulations regardless of this value. Changing the desired value makes the Network Server transmit the `DutyCycleReq` MAC command.

- term: ADR ACK limit
  description: This value changes the `ADR_ACK_LIMIT` value defining the ADR back-off algorithm. Changing the desired value makes the Network Server transmit the `ADRParamSetupReq` MAC command (from LoRaWAN 1.1).

  description: The class B ping slot uses a fixed frequency and data rate. This value configures the data rate to use in class B ping slots. See LoRaWAN Regional Parameters to find the band's modulation settings for each data rate index. Changing the desired value makes the Network Server transmit the `PingSlotChannelReq` MAC command.

- term: Ping slot frequency
  description: The class B ping slot uses a fixed frequency and data rate. This value configures the frequency to use in class B ping slots. Changing the desired value makes the Network Server transmit the `PingSlotChannelReq` MAC command.

  description: The maximum allowed Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP). The end device uses this value as the maximum, it shall never use a higher EIRP, but a lower EIRP is allowed. This value is given in dBm. Changing the desired value makes the Network Server transmit the `TxParamSetupReq`.

- term: Received Signal Strength Indicator
  description: The received signal power in milliwatts, measured in dBm. This value is used as a measurement of how well the signal is received. RSSI is used in the ADR feedback loop to determine if a signal is being received with enough power to allow the device to increase its data rate and conserve battery. A high RSSI means the device can reduce transmission power and messages will still be received.
