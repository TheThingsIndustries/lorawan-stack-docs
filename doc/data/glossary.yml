- term: Join Server
  description: A Join Server is a component of the LoRaWAN server defined in the LoRaWAN Backend Interfaces. The Things Stack contains a Join Server, which is used by default unless an External Join Server is specified. The Join Server's role is to store root keys, generate session keys, and to send those securely to the Network Server and Application Server of choice. The device contains the same root keys, which can be provisioned as part of assembly, distribution or upon installation. An External Join Server allows for secure end device provisioning without network lock-in. The owner uses a device claiming procedure to transfer ownership in the Join Server.

- term: Packet Forwarder
  description: A Packet Forwarder is a program running on a Gateway that receives and transmits LoRa packets, and forwards these packets to and from a Network Server.

- term: Semtech UDP Packet Forwarder
  description: The Semtech UDP Packet Forwarder is the first packet forwarder, connecting to servers through the Semtech UDP protocol. Although this protocol has several drawbacks, many gateways include a pre-compiled version of the packet forwarder, which makes it easy to test a gateway with this protocol.

- term: Activation Mode
  description: "**Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA)** is the preferred and most secure way to connect a device. Devices perform a join-procedure with the network, during which a dynamic Device Address is assigned and security keys are negotiated with the device. **Activation by Personalization (ABP)** requires hardcoding the Device Address as well as the security keys in the device. This strategy might seem simpler, because you skip the join procedure, but it has downsides related to security. ABP also has the downside that devices can not switch network providers without manually changing keys in the device. **Multicast** is a virtual group of ABP devices which allows all devices to receive the same downlinks. Multicast groups do not support uplinks."

- term: Gateway
  description: Gateways form the bridge between [End Devices](#end-device) and Network Servers. Devices use low power networks like LoRa to connect to the Gateway, while the Gateway uses high bandwidth networks like WiFi, Ethernet or Cellular to connect to a Network Server.

Making the spreading factor 1 step lower (from SF10 to SF9) allows you to roughly send the same amount of data use half the time on air. Lowering the spreading factor makes it more difficult for the gateway to receive a transmission, as it will be more sensitive to noise.

  link: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/classes.html

- term: Class A
  description: Class A devices support bi-directional communication between a device and a gateway. Uplink messages (from the device to the server) can be sent at any time (randomly). The device then opens two receive windows at specified times after an uplink transmission. The first receive window (Rx1) is set to 5 seconds and can be modified. The second receive window (Rx2) always comes 1 second after Rx1.
  link: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/classes.html

- term: Class B
  description: Class B devices extend Class A by adding scheduled receive windows for downlink messages from the server. Using time-synchronized beacons transmitted by the gateway, the devices periodically open receive windows.
  link: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/classes.html

- term: Class C
  description: Class C devices extend Class A by keeping the receive windows open unless they are transmitting. This allows for low-latency communication but is many times more energy consuming than Class A devices.
