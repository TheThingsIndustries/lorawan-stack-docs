      Delete a batch of end devices with the given IDs.

      This operation is atomic; either all devices are deleted or none.
      Devices not found are skipped and no error is returned.
      Before calling this RPC, use the corresponding BatchDelete RPCs
      of NsEndDeviceRegistry, AsEndDeviceRegistry and
      optionally the JsEndDeviceRegistry to delete the end devices.
      If the devices were claimed on a Join Server, use the BatchUnclaim RPC
      of the DeviceClaimingServer.
      This is NOT done automatically.
