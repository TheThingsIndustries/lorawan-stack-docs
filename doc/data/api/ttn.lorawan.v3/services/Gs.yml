      Get statistics about gateway connections to the Gateway Server of a batch of gateways.
      - Statistics are not persisted between reconnects.
      - Gateways that are not connected or are part of a different cluster are ignored.
      - The client should ensure that the requested gateways are in the requested cluster.
      - The client should have the right to get the gateway connection stats on all requested gateways.
