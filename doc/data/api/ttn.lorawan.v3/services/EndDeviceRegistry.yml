comment: |-
  The EndDeviceRegistry service, exposed by the Identity Server, is used to manage
  end device registrations.

  After registering an end device, it also needs to be registered in
  the NsEndDeviceRegistry that is exposed by the Network Server,
  the AsEndDeviceRegistry that is exposed by the Application Server,
  and the JsEndDeviceRegistry that is exposed by the Join Server.

  Before deleting an end device it first needs to be deleted from the
  NsEndDeviceRegistry, the AsEndDeviceRegistry and the JsEndDeviceRegistry.

      List end devices in the given application.
      Similar to Get, this selects the fields given by the field mask.
      More or less fields may be returned, depending on the rights of the caller.

      Delete the end device with the given IDs.

      Before deleting an end device it first needs to be deleted from the
      NsEndDeviceRegistry, the AsEndDeviceRegistry and the JsEndDeviceRegistry.
      In addition, if the device claimed on a Join Server, it also needs to be
      unclaimed via the DeviceClaimingServer so it can be claimed in the future.
      This is NOT done automatically.
