      Get the gateway with the given identifiers, selecting the fields specified
      in the field mask.
      More or less fields may be returned, depending on the rights of the caller.

      List gateways where the given user or organization is a direct collaborator.
      If no user or organization is given, this returns the gateways the caller
      has access to.
      Similar to Get, this selects the fields given by the field mask.
      More or less fields may be returned, depending on the rights of the caller.
    input:
      name: ListGatewaysRequest
    output:
      name: Gateways
    http:
    - method: GET
      path: /gateways
    - method: GET
      path: /users/{collaborator.user_ids.user_id}/gateways
    - method: GET
      path: /organizations/{collaborator.organization_ids.organization_id}/gateways

    - method: PUT
      path: /gateways/{gateway.ids.gateway_id}
  Delete:
    name: Delete
    comment: Delete the gateway. This may not release the gateway ID for reuse, but
      it does release the EUI.
    input:
      name: GatewayIdentifiers
    output:
      package: google.protobuf
      name: Empty
    http:
    - method: DELETE
      path: /gateways/{gateway_id}
  Restore:
    name: Restore
    comment: |-
      Restore a recently deleted gateway. This does not restore the EUI,
      as that was released when deleting the gateway.

      Deployment configuration may specify if, and for how long after deletion,
      entities can be restored.
    input:
      name: GatewayIdentifiers
    output:
      package: google.protobuf
      name: Empty
    http:
    - method: POST
      path: /gateways/{gateway_id}/restore
  Purge:
    name: Purge
    comment: |-
      Purge the gateway. This will release both gateway ID and EUI for reuse.
      The gateway owner is responsible for clearing data from any (external) integrations
      that may store and expose data by gateway ID.
    input:
      name: GatewayIdentifiers
    output:
      package: google.protobuf
      name: Empty
    http:
    - method: DELETE
      path: /gateways/{gateway_id}/purge
