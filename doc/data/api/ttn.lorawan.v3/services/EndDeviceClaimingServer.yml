      Authorize the End Device Claiming Server to claim devices registered in the given application. The application
      identifiers are the source application, where the devices are registered before they are claimed.
      The API key is used to access the application, find the device, verify the claim request and delete the end device
      from the source application.
      DEPRECATED: Device claiming that transfers devices between applications is no longer supported and will be removed
      in a future version of The Things Stack.
