    The address of the Gateway Server to connect to.
    This information is public and can be seen by any authenticated user in the network if status_public is true.
    The typical format of the address is "scheme://host:port". The scheme is optional. If the port is omitted,
    the normal port inference (with DNS lookup, otherwise defaults) is used.
    The connection shall be established with transport layer security (TLS).
    Custom certificate authorities may be configured out-of-band.

  comment: |-
    Enable server-side buffering of downlink messages. This is recommended for gateways using the Semtech UDP Packet
    Forwarder v2.x or older, as it does not feature a just-in-time queue. If enabled, the Gateway Server schedules the
    downlink message late to the gateway so that it does not overwrite previously scheduled downlink messages that have
    not been transmitted yet.

    Enforcing gateway duty cycle is recommended for all gateways to respect spectrum regulations. Disable enforcing the

    The LoRa Basics Station LNS secret.

    The authentication code for gateway claiming.
    Requires the RIGHT_GATEWAY_READ_SECRETS for reading and RIGHT_GATEWAY_WRITE_SECRETS for updating this value.
    The entire field must be used in RPCs since sub-fields are validated wrt to each other. Direct selection/update of sub-fields only are not allowed.
    Use the top level field mask `claim_authentication_code` even when updating single fields.
