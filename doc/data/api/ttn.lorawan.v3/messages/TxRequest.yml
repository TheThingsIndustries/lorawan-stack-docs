name: TxRequest
comment: |-
  TxRequest is a request for transmission.
  If sent to a roaming partner, this request is used to generate the DLMetadata Object (see Backend Interfaces 1.0, Table 22).
  If the gateway has a scheduler, this request is sent to the gateway, in the order of gateway_ids.
  Otherwise, the Gateway Server attempts to schedule the request and creates the TxSettings.

    Downlink paths used to select a gateway for downlink.
    In class A, the downlink paths are required to only contain uplink tokens.
    In class B and C, the downlink paths may contain uplink tokens and fixed gateways antenna identifiers.

    Priority for scheduling.
    Requests with a higher priority are allocated more channel time than messages with a lower priority, in duty-cycle limited regions.
    A priority of HIGH or higher sets the HiPriorityFlag in the DLMetadata Object.

  comment: |-
    Time when the downlink message should be transmitted.
    This value is only valid for class C downlink; class A downlink uses uplink tokens and class B downlink is scheduled on ping slots.
    This requires the gateway to have GPS time sychronization.
    If the absolute time is not set, the first available time will be used that does not conflict or violate regional limitations.
