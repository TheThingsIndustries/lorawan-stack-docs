<!--more-->

{{% tts %}}'s [CLI]({{<ref "/reference/cli">}}) and [components]({{<ref "/components">}}) collect telemetry data, which is used to help us understand how users interact with the product. For example, we gain insights on how users make use of organization, what environment is used to run the CLI etc. Telemetry collection is **enabled** by default and does **not** collect personally identifiable information. The following subsections explain what information is collected and how it is anonymised.
