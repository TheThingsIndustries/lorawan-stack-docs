The LoRa Cloud Modem and Geolocation Services v1 application package communicates the uplinks received from a compatible device to the LoRa Cloud Modem and Geolocation Services, and schedules the downlinks received from the service back to the device.

More information on the LoRa Cloud Modem and Geolocation Services can be found in the [official LoRa documentation](https://www.loracloud.com/documentation/device_management?url=overview.html).

## Creating a New Uplink Token

In order to use the LoRa Cloud Modem and Geolocation Services application package, a new access token must be created in order to allow the Application Server to send the uplinks to the Device & Application Services.

The new token can be created in the LoRa Cloud Modem and Geolocation Services portal, in the **Token Management** section.

After filling in the token name and clicking the **Add New Token** button, the token will be created.

## Enabling the Package

{{< cli-only >}}

The package can now be enabled using the `default-associations set` command:

```bash
APP_ID="app1"
F_PORT=199
# Create a JSON formatted file containing the uplink token
echo '{ "token": "AQEAdqwV67..." }' > package-data.json
# Create the association
ttn-lw-cli applications packages default-associations set $APP_ID $F_PORT --package-name lora-cloud-device-management-v1 --data-local-file package-data.json
```

This will enable the package on FPort `199` of all of the devices of application `app1`. You can now use the LoRa Cloud Modem and Geolocation Services in order to manage your device!

## Using a Custom Server URL

{{< cli-only >}}

The package may be configured to use a custom server URL using the package data:

```bash
# Create a JSON formatted file containing the uplink token and the server URL
echo '{ "token": "AQEAdqwV67...", "server_url": "https://app.example.com/" }' > package-data.json
# Create or update the default association
ttn-lw-cli applications packages default-associations set $APP_ID $F_PORT --package-name lora-cloud-device-management-v1 --data-local-file package-data.json
```

## Package Data JSON Schema

The package data format is common between both default associations and associations, and should contain the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description | Required | Default value |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| `token` | `string` | The acces token to be used by the package to submit uplinks to the LoRa Cloud Modem and Geolocation Services | Yes | None. |
| `server_url` | `URL` | The custom base URL to be used for service communication | No | `https://mgs.loracloud.com`

Fields can be customized on a per device basis, by overriding the field in the package data of the association.
