## General Options

- `is.delete.restore`: Defines how long after soft-deletion an entity can be restored

## Database Options

The Identity Server needs to be connected to a PostgreSQL-compatible database. Details for the form of the URI can be found in the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING).

- `is.database-uri`: Database connection URI
- `is.database-max-idle-conns` {{< distributions "Cloud" "Enterprise" >}}: Maximum number of idle database connections (default `10`)

- `is.read-database-uri` {{< distributions "Cloud" "Enterprise" >}}: Read-Only database connection URI

## Email Options

The Identity Server can be configured with different providers for sending emails. Currently the `sendgrid`, `smtp` and `dir` providers are implemented.

- `is.email.provider`: Email provider to use

When `sendgrid` is used as provider, an API key is required. For testing, use the sandbox to prevent emails from actually being sent.

- `is.email.sendgrid.api-key`: The SendGrid API key to use
- `is.email.sendgrid.sandbox`: Use SendGrid sandbox mode for testing

When `smtp` is used as provider, provide the address of the SMTP server (`host:port`), as well as the username and password for the SMTP server.

- `is.email.smtp.address`: SMTP server address
- `is.email.smtp.username`: Username to authenticate with
- `is.email.smtp.password`: Password to authenticate with
- `is.email.smtp.connections`: Maximum number of connections to the SMTP server

When `dir` is used as provider, provide the path to the local directory where email messages should be written to.

- `is.email.dir`: Path to the local directory where email messages should be written to

The email address and name of the sender should be configured regardless of the provider that is used.

- `is.email.sender-address`: The address of the sender
- `is.email.sender-name`: The name of the sender

Most emails contain the name of the network and links to the Identity Server or Console.

- `is.email.network.name`: The name of the network
- `is.email.network.identity-server-url`: The URL of the Identity Server
- `is.email.network.console-url`: The URL of the Console

Although {{% tts %}} comes with a number of builtin email templates, it is possible to override those with custom templates. You can specify the source where to load templates from, and options for that source. For more information on email templates, see the [email templates reference]({{< ref "/reference/email-templates" >}}). {{< removed-in-version "3.19" >}}

- `is.email.templates.source`: Source of the email template files (directory, url, blob) {{< deprecated-in-version "3.19" >}}
- `is.email.templates.directory`: Directory on the filesystem where email templates are located {{< deprecated-in-version "3.19" >}}
- `is.email.templates.url`: URL where email templates are located {{< deprecated-in-version "3.19" >}}

- `is.email.templates.blob.path`: Path within the bucket {{< deprecated-in-version "3.19" >}}

If your custom templates rely on other files, such as headers or footers, those files need to be included.

- `is.email.templates.includes`: The email templates that will be preloaded on startup {{< deprecated-in-version "3.19" >}}

## OAuth UI Options

The OAuth user interface needs to be configured with at least the canonical URL and the base URL of the Identity Server's HTTP API. The canonical URL needs to be the full URL of the UI, and looks like `https://thethings.example.com/oauth`. The base URL of the Identity Server's HTTP API looks like `https://thethings.example.com/api/v3`.

- `is.oauth.ui.canonical-url`: The page canonical URL

If you do not want to serve the OAuth user interface on `/oauth`, you may customize the mount path.

- `is.oauth.mount`: Path on the server where the OAuth server will be served

If page assets for the OAuth UI are served from a CDN or on a different path on the server, the base URL needs to be customized as well. If you want to [customize the branding]({{< ref "the-things-stack/management/branding" >}}) of the OAuth UI, you can set the base URL for where your branding assets are located.

## User Registration Options

By default, users can register their own user accounts. User accounts can also be registered by admin users in the network. The user registration process can be customized by requiring approval by admin users, requiring email validation or by requiring new users to be invited by existing users.

- `is.user-registration.enabled`: Enable user registration. If user registration is disabled, admin users can still create users. 
- `is.user-registration.admin-approval.required`: Require admin approval for new users

- `is.user-login.disable-credentials-login` {{< distributions "Cloud" "Enterprise" >}}: Disable login with credentials

## User Rights Options

By default users can create applications, gateways, organizations and OAuth clients. With the following configuration options it is possible to restrict this, in which case only admin users are allowed to create these entities. By adding users to organizations, and assigning the appropriate rights, they can still create these entities in the organization.

- `is.user-rights.create-applications`: Allow non-admin users to create applications in their user account
- `is.user-rights.create-clients`: Allow non-admin users to create OAuth clients in their user account
- `is.user-rights.create-gateways`: Allow non-admin users to create gateways in their user account
- `is.user-rights.create-organizations`: Allow non-admin users to create organizations in their user account

## Entity Limits Options {#entity-limits-options}

By default, users can create an unlimited number of applications, gateways, organizations and OAuth clients. With the following configuration options, it is possible to restrict this. These configuration options apply to _newly created_ applications, organizations and users. Limits for existing applications, organizations and users can be modified by admin users.

- `is.application-limits.end-devices`: The end devices limit for newly created applications.
- `is.organization-limits.applications`: The applications limit for newly created organizations.
- `is.organization-limits.clients`: The clients limit for newly created organizations.
- `is.organization-limits.gateways`: The gateways limit for newly created organizations.
- `is.user-limits.applications`: The applications limit for newly created users; this limit applies to direct memberships, not to indirect memberships through organizations.
- `is.user-limits.clients`: The clients limit for newly created users; this limit applies to direct memberships, not to indirect memberships through organizations.
- `is.user-limits.gateways`: The gateways limit for newly created users; this limit applies to direct memberships, not to indirect memberships through organizations.
- `is.user-limits.organizations`: The organizations limit for newly created users.

## Admin Rights Options {#admin-rights-options}

By default admins are granted _almost_ all rights on all entities in the network. The default configuration does not allow admins to read secrets, such as the root keys of end devices, and the CUPS/LNS secrets of gateways. This also means that admins can not assign those rights to others. The following option can be used to grant admin users all possible rights.

- `is.admin-rights.all`: Grant all rights to admins, including `_KEYS` and `_ALL`

## Gateway Secrets Encryption Options{#gateway-secrets-encryption-options}

- `is.gateways.encryption-key-id`: ID of the key used to encrypt gateway secrets at rest.

## Tenant Administration Options 

{{< distributions "Cloud" "Enterprise" >}} In multi-tenant deployments, tenants are managed with "tenant admin keys". These keys need to be configured in the Identity Server.

- `is.tenancy.admin-keys` {{< distributions "Cloud" "Enterprise" >}}: Keys that can be used for tenant administration (16, 24 or 32 hex-encoded bytes)

## Cache Options

- `is.auth-cache.membership-ttl`: TTL of membership caches

## DevEUI Issuer Options

- `is.dev-eui-block.enabled`: Enable DevEUI address issuing from IEEE MAC block
- `is.dev-eui-block.application-limit`: Maximum DevEUI addresses to be issued per application
- `is.dev-eui-block.init-counter`: Initial counter value for the addresses to be issued (default 0)
- `is.dev-eui-block.prefix`: DevEUI block prefix (default "0000000000000000/0")

## Login Tokens

{{% tts %}} allows using login tokens (magic login links) for password-less login.

- `is.login-tokens.enabled`: Enable users requesting login tokens
- `is.login-tokens.token-ttl`: TTL of login tokens

## Network Options

{{% tts %}} Identity Server supports LoRaWAN® Backend Interfaces, so it is possible to obtain an end device's NetID, Tenant ID and Network Server address with the use of a vendor-specific extension.

- `is.network.net-id`: The NetID of the network. When running a Network Server, this needs to be the same value as `ns.net-id`.
- `is.network.tenant-id`: The Tenant ID in the host NetID. Leave blank if the used NetID is dedicated for this Identity Server.
