## Global Options

Under normal circumstances, only `info`, `warn` and `error` logs are printed to the console. For development, you may also want to see `debug` logs.

- `log.level`: The minimum level log messages must have to be shown (default "info")

The format of logs is also configurable. {{% tts %}} supports `console` format (that prints logs as a human-friendly text) and `json` format (that prints logs as JSON).

- `log.format`: Log format to write

## License

{{< distributions "Cloud" "Enterprise" >}} {{% tts %}} requires a license key for production use. For development purposes, it will work for a limited time on `localhost` without a license key.

- `license.key`: Contents of the license key. Must be a base64-encoded string.
- `license.file`: Location of the license file. Must be a binary file containing the raw license bytes.

Given the license key in base64 format, you can create the license file like this:

```bash
$ echo "AzYFASd/Gcggs..." | base64 --decode > ttn-lw-stack-license.bin
```

## Key Vault

{{< distributions "Cloud" "Enterprise" >}} The key vault is used to store secrets, such as TLS certificates and the keys for encrypting LoRaWANÂ® root keys in the database. These secrets can also be cached. {{% tts %}} supports keys stored in AWS Secrets Manager, or static configuration for development purposes.

- `key-vault.provider`: Provider (`static` or `aws`)
- `key-vault.static`: Static key encryption keys; values use hex encoding

- `interop.packet-broker.enabled`: Enable Packet Broker to authenticate
- `interop.packet-broker.token-issuer`: The issuer of the incoming OAuth 2.0 token from Packet Broker is verified against this value.

## Redis Options

Redis is the main data store for the [Network Server]({{< relref "network-server.md" >}}), [Application Server]({{< relref "application-server.md" >}}) and [Join Server]({{< relref "join-server.md" >}}). Redis is also used by the [Identity Server]({{< relref "identity-server.md" >}}) for caching and can be used by the [events system]({{< ref "#events-options" >}}) for exchanging events between components.

Redis configuration options:

- `redis.password`: Password of the Redis server
- `redis.database`: Redis database to use
- `redis.namespace`: Namespace for Redis keys
- `redis.pool-size`: The maximum size of the connection pool

If connecting to a single Redis instance:

- `redis.address`: Address of the Redis server

Or you can enable failover using [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel):

- `redis.failover.enable`: Set to `true`
- `redis.failover.addresses`: List of addresses of the Redis Sentinel instances (required)
- `redis.failover.master-name`: Redis Sentinel master name (required)

Further, you can reduce the load on the Redis master by specifying read-only configuration:

Mutual TLS is not supported yet.

## Blob Options

The `blob` options configure how {{% tts %}} reads or writes files such as pictures, the frequency plans repository or files required for Backend Interfaces interoperability. The `provider` field selects the provider that is used, and which other options are read.

- `blob.provider`: Blob store provider (local, aws, gcp, azure) (default `local`)

If the blob provider is `local`, you need to specify the directory to use.

- `blob.local.directory`: Local directory that holds the buckets (default `./public/blob`)

There is also an experimental support for `azure` provider. Only authentication via Managed Identity is supported.

- `blob.azure.account-name`: Azure storage account name

## Events Options

The `events` options configure how events are shared between components. When using a single instance of {{% tts %}}, the `internal` backend is the best option. If you need to communicate in a cluster, you can use the `redis` or `cloud` backend.

- `events.backend`: Backend to use for events (internal, redis, cloud) (default "internal")

When using the `redis` backend, the global [Redis configuration]({{< ref "#redis-options" >}}) is used. Alternatively, you may customize the Redis configuration that is used for events.

- `events.redis.address`: Address of the Redis server
- `events.redis.password`: Password of the Redis server
- `events.redis.database`: Redis database to use
- `events.redis.namespace`: Namespace for Redis keys
- `events.redis.pool-size`: The maximum size of the connection pool

If your Redis server uses TLS, use the following options:

- `events.redis.tls.require`: Require TLS when connecting to Redis
- `events.redis.tls.root-ca`: Location of TLS root CA certificate
- `events.redis.tls.insecure-skip-verify`: Skip verification of certificate chains (insecure)

Mutual TLS is not supported yet.

With the `cloud` backend, the configured publish and subscribe URLs are passed to [the Go CDK](https://gocloud.dev/howto/pubsub/).

- `events.cloud.publish-url`: URL for the topic to send events
- `events.cloud.subscribe-url`: URL for the subscription to receiving events

## Frequency Plans Options

The `frequency-plans` configuration is used by the [Gateway Server]({{< relref "gateway-server.md" >}}) and the [Network Server]({{< relref "network-server.md" >}}). It can load configuration from a number of sources.

- `frequency-plans.config-source`: Source of the frequency plans (static, directory, url, blob)

The `url` source loads frequency plans from the given URL. See the [lorawan-frequency-plans](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-frequency-plans) repository for more information.

- `frequency-plans.url`

The `directory` source loads from the given directory.

- `frequency-plans.directory`

The `blob` source loads from the given path in a bucket. This requires the global [blob configuration]({{< ref "#blob-options" >}}).

- `frequency-plans.blob.bucket`: Bucket to use
- `frequency-plans.blob.path`: Path to use

## Cluster Options

The `cluster` options configure how {{% tts %}} communicates with other components in the cluster. These options do not need to be set when running a single instance of {{% tts %}}. The most important options are the ones to configure the addresses of the other components in the cluster.

- `cluster.address`: Address to use for cluster communication
- `cluster.name`: Name of the current cluster peer
- `cluster.identity-server`: Address for the Identity Server
- `cluster.gateway-server`: Address for the Gateway Server
- `cluster.network-server`: Address for the Network Server
- `cluster.application-server`: Address for the Application Server
- `cluster.join-server`: Address for the Join Server
- `cluster.crypto-server`: Address for the Crypto Server
- `cluster.gateway-contiguration-server`: Address of the Gateway Configuration Server
- `cluster.join`: Addresses of cluster peers to join

The next thing to configure is how peers discover each other, and how peers claim IDs.

{{% tts %}} currently only supports `DNS` discovery. In this discovery mechanism cluster peers periodically perform DNS lookups for the configured addresses. If an address is of the form `host:port` the peers will be discovered by looking up the `A` records for that address, and connecting to the configured port. If an address is only a hostname, the peers will be discovered by looking up the `SRV` records for that address, then looking up the `A` records for each returned address and connecting to the port that was set on the `SRV` record.

- `cluster.discovery-mode`: Peer discovery mode

{{% tts %}} currently only supports the `redis` backend for ID claiming. This uses the same Redis instance as the one used for the cache. When a gateway connects to a Gateway Server, the Gateway Server will register itself in Redis for the given gateway ID. When a Network Server needs to send a downlink to a gateway, it will look up the registered Gateway Server for the given gateway ID. To avoid hitting Redis every time a Network Server needs to send a downlink, it has a local cache of these ID claims.

- `cluster.claim.backend`: ID claiming backend
- `cluster.claim.cache.size`: Maximum size of the local ID claims cache
- `cluster.claim.cache.ttl`: TTL of locally cached ID claims

The cluster keys are 128 bit, hex-encoded keys that cluster components use to authenticate to each other.

- `cluster.keys`: Keys used to communicate between components of the cluster. The first one will be used by the cluster to identify itself

It is possible to configure the cluster to use TLS or not. We recommend to enable TLS for production deployments. The server name used in the TLS handshake between cluster peers can be overridden so that {{% tts %}} can connect to cluster peers using private (IP) addresses, while using a (public) TLS certificate that doesn't include those private addresses.

- `cluster.tls`: Do cluster gRPC over TLS
- `cluster.tls-server-name`: Server name to use in TLS handshake to cluster peers

{{% tts %}} can be configured to connect to Packet Broker via Packet Broker Agent component.

- `cluster.packet-broker-agent`: Defines the address of the Packet Broker Agent

It is possible to configure {{% tts %}} with Device Repository profiles from different vendors. This allows reusing standard end device profiles for module makers and LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.

- `cluster.device-repository`: Defines the address of the Device Repository

## Cache Options

{{% tts %}} can optionally be configured to use a cache.

- `cache.service`: Configure the backing store that will be used for the cache. Currently, only `redis` is supported

When using the `redis` backend, the global [Redis configuration]({{< ref "#redis-options" >}}) is used. Alternatively, you may customize the Redis configuration that is used for the cache.

- `cache.redis.address`: Address of the Redis server
- `cache.redis.password`: Password of the Redis server
- `cache.redis.database`: Redis database to use
- `cache.redis.namespace`: Namespace for Redis keys
- `cache.redis.pool-size`: The maximum size of the connection pool

See [Redis configuration]({{< ref "#redis-options" >}}) for more options.

## Multi-Tenancy 

{{< distributions "Cloud" "Enterprise" >}} In multi-tenant deployments, some additional configuration is required.

- `tenancy.base-domains` {{< distributions "Cloud" "Enterprise" >}}: Base domains for tenant ID inference. Setting this to `thethings.example.com` would extract the tenant ID from `<tenant-id>.thethings.example.com`. 
- `tenancy.default-id` {{< distributions "Cloud" "Enterprise" >}}: Default tenant ID. Users visiting `thethings.example.com` (from `tenancy.base-domains`) will be redirected to `default.thethings.example.com`. 

Tenants can have custom configuration, such as custom branding or custom user registration options. This information is typically cached locally, especially in multi-region deployments to reduce the load on the Identity Server and to be more resilient against outages of the Identity Server.

- `tenancy.ttl`: TTL of cached tenant configurations {{< distributions "Cloud" "Enterprise" >}}

## Rate Limiting

{{% tts %}} supports rate limiting external endpoints. See [Rate Limiting]({{< ref "/reference/rate-limiting" >}}) for more details.

- `rate-limiting.blob.bucket`: Bucket to use
- `rate-limiting.blob.path`: Path to use
- `rate-limiting.config-source`: Source of the `rate-limiting.yml` file (directory, url, blob)
- `rate-limiting.directory`: Filesystem directory which contains rate limiting configuration
- `rate-limiting.memory.max-size`: Maximum store size for the rate limiter
- `rate-limiting.url`: URL which contains rate limiting configuration

## Resource Limiting

{{< distributions "Dedicated Cloud" "Enterprise" "AWS Launcher" >}}  {{% tts %}} supports configuring maximum limits for active resources (e.g. number of active application data-plane MQTT connections). Resource limiting configuration can only be set from the configuration file. See [Resource Limiting]({{< ref "/reference/resource-limiting" >}}) for more details.

## Version Check

{{% tts %}} performs a version check upon running by default, and prints a corresponding message if a newer version is available.

- `skip-version-check`: Set to `true` to skip version check

## Experimental Features

{{% tts %}} supports experimental features.

- `experimental.features`: Experimental features to activate
