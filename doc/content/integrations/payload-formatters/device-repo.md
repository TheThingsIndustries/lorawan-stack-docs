Device manufacturers may submit payload formatters designed to work with their devices. The data and code are publicly available in the [Github Repository](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices). You can find all devices in the Device Repository on [this page](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/device-repository/).

If you're a device manufacturer and you would like to add your device to the repository, find out how [here](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices/blob/master/README.md). Adding your device makes it easy for users to use it with {{% tts %}}, and is a good way to publicly document information and code related to your device.
