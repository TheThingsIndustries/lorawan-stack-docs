The AWS IoT Integration for {{% tts %}} puts logs to AWS CloudWatch where you can find detailed traces and errors.

<!--more-->

In the AWS Console, open **Services** and go to **CloudWatch**.

In the menu on the left, under **Logs**, go to **Log Groups**.

{{< figure src="../troubleshooting-log-groups.png" alt="Log Groups" >}}

{{< note >}} **Not seeing all log groups?** The log groups are created automatically as log entries are written to an underlying log streams. {{</ note >}}

First place to look for issues with thing creation or claiming is the `/thethings/lorawan/<stack-name>/things` log group. Each thing has its own log stream in this log group. For example, if you [created or claimed a thing]({{< relref "things" >}}) but it doesn't show up in {{% tts %}}, you can find the cause in the thing's log stream.

For further details, you can look at the log entries of the Lambda functions:

- `/aws/lambda/<stack-name>-ConfigureFunction...`: configuration
- `/aws/lambda/<stack-name>-CreateThingTypeFunction...`: create the thing type
- `/aws/lambda/<stack-name>-ClaimThingFunction...`: thing claiming
- `/aws/lambda/<stack-name>-CreateThingFunction...`: thing creation
- `/aws/lambda/<stack-name>-HandleDownlinkFunction...`: downlink handling
- `/aws/lambda/<stack-name>-HandleUplinkFunction...`: uplink handling
