{{% tts %}} publishes uplink messages to AWS IoT Core MQTT. An IoT Core rule triggers a Lambda function which processes the message, creates a new IoT Core thing if it doesn't exist, and updates the shadow state with metrics. Device activations and uplink messages get republished so your application can act on them.

<!--more-->

Your application can schedule downlink messages by publishing a JSON object to an AWS IoT Core MQTT topic. An IoT Core rule triggers a Lambda function which performs an API call to {{% tts %}} to enqueue the downlink message.

See [Architecture]({{< relref "architecture" >}}) for the flow.

## Activations and Uplink Messages

The AWS IoT Integration for {{% tts %}} uses the following topics for upstream traffic:

- Activations: `lorawan/<thing>/join`
- Uplink: `lorawan/<thing>/uplink`

See [Manage Things]({{< relref "things" >}}) to learn about the thing names.

{{< note >}} Use [**Rules for AWS IoT**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-rules.html) to act on these messages for storage, analytics, alarms and API calls. {{</ note >}}

{{< note >}} This guide uses AWS IoT Core MQTT client for demonstration purposes only. {{</ note >}}

In the AWS Console, open **Services** and go to **IoT Core**.

In the menu on the left, open **Test** and click **MQTT test client**.

In **Subscription topic**, enter `lorawan/#` to subscribe to all events from all LoRaWANÂ® things in your account.

Click **Subscribe**.

## Downlink Messages

The AWS IoT Integration for {{% tts %}} uses the `lorawan/downlink` topic for downstream traffic.

Feedback events are published on the following topics:

- `lorawan/<thing>/downlink/queued` (when any downlink has been queued)
- `lorawan/<thing>/downlink/sent` (when the downlink has been sent by the Network Server)
- `lorawan/<thing>/downlink/failed` (when the Network Server failed to send the downlink message)
- `lorawan/<thing>/downlink/ack` (when the end device acknowledged the confirmed downlink message)
- `lorawan/<thing>/downlink/nack` (when the end device did not acknowledge the confirmed downlink message)

{{< note >}} Publish downlink messages from your application to IoT Core using [**AWS IoT Data Plane**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/Welcome.html#Welcome_AWS_IoT_Data_Plane) using the [**Publish**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_iotdata_Publish.html) action. {{</ note >}}

{{< note >}} This guide uses AWS IoT Core MQTT client for demonstration purposes only. {{</ note >}}

Still in the AWS IoT **MQTT client**, enter the downlink topic `lorawan/downlink`.

The message is a JSON object with the following format:

```js
{
  "thingName": "<thingName>",

  "bytes": "AQ==", // Base64 encoded FRMPayload
  // or
  "payload": {     // JSON encoded payload
    "field1": 42
  },

  // Optional fields
  "fPort": 10,         // FPort (default: 1)
  "confirmed": true,   // Confirmed data downlink (default: false)
  "highPriority": true // High priority (default: false)
}
```

When you publish downlink this way, you will immediately see a message on `lorawan/<thing>/downlink/queued`. Keep an eye on other messages published to `lorawan/<thing>/downlink/#` for the sent, failed, acknowledged and not acknowledged events.

See [Manage Things]({{< relref "things" >}}) to find the `thingName` for the end device.
