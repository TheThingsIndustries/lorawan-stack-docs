[Datacake](https://datacake.co/) is a multi-purpose IoT platform, which provides the possibility of building custom IoT applications, without requiring programming skills.

## Prerequisites

1. A [user account on Datacake](https://app.datacake.de/signup).

## Setup Datacake

First, create a **Workspace** on Datacake by navigating to the **Create Workspace** button in the upper left corner. 

{{< figure src="datacake-workspace.png" alt="Add workspace on Datacake" >}}

On the left hand menu, click **Devices**. To add a new device, click the **Add Device** button on the right. 

In the **Add Device** pop-up menu, choose **LoRaWAN** &#8594; **Generic LoRa Device**. When asked **Which device are you missing?**, just click **Skip** and then select **The Things Industries** adapter.

After selecting your subscription plan, fill in **Name** and **DevEUI** for your device, then click on **Add Device** to finish.

Once the device is created, you can click on it in the **Devices** menu to enter its settings.

In the **Configuration** tab, you can find the **LoRaWAN** section, where you can configure **Network** settings, choose to **Authenticate Webhook** or define **Payload Decoder**. 

Under **Network**, choose **The Things Industries** from the drop-down menu.

Paste your device's **End device ID** from {{% tts %}} in the **TTI Dev Id** field.

The **TTI Server Url** field should contain the URL of your {{% tts %}} deployment. See the [Server Addresses section]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/concepts/server-addresses" >}}) for more info.

Paste your **Application ID** from {{% tts %}} in the **TTI App Id** field. 

In {{% tts %}}, navigate to **API keys** on the left hand menu, click the **Add API key** button, give it a **Name** and confirm that you have copied it to finish. Paste the copied API key into the **TTI Api Key** field on Datacake.

## Configure {{% tts %}}

After finishing Datacake setup, use the **Datacake** [Webhook template]({{< ref "/integrations/webhooks/webhook-templates" >}}) to create a Webhook integration on {{% tts %}}.

To integrate, you only need to fill out the **Webhook ID** field and provide an [API token](https://docs.datacake.de/api/generate-access-token) from Datacake for the authorization.

To see the values of all parameters of the Datacake integration, click on the integration after you created it with the Webhook template.

Once the setup is finished, you can navigate to device's **Debug** tab on Datacake, where you can see the incoming messages and manipulate or monitor your data.

Check the official Datacake documentation to learn how to [decode the payload](https://docs.datacake.de/lorawan/payload-decoders) received from {{% tts %}}.

## Scheduling Downlinks

In addition to forwarding messages from {{% tts %}} to Datacake, you can also schedule downlink messages to be sent from Datacake to your end device.

Enter your device's settings page on Datacake and go to the **Downlinks** tab.

Click the **Add Downlink** button.

Next, fill in the **Name** field, define the **Payload encoder** and click **Save Downlink**. 

Learn to write payload decoders in the [official Datacake documentation](https://docs.datacake.de/lorawan/downlinks#writing-a-downlink-encoder).

Now simply click the **Send Downlink** button to schedule a downlink and check your device's logs to see the incoming message.
