<!--more-->

## Prerequisites

1. Access to an Azure account. [Create a new account](https://signup.azure.com/)
2. An application in {{% tts %}}. [See instructions]({{< ref "/integrations/adding-applications" >}})

## Create API Key

Go to your application in {{% tts %}} Console, navigate to **Integrations &#8594; Azure IoT** on the left hand menu and click on **Expand** next to **Azure IoT Hub**. Now click on **Generate API Key**.

Copy the generated API key and store it in a safe place, because you will need it in the next section.

Leave the integration page open, as you will need to copy in your **Azure IoT Hub hostname** and **Azure IoT Hub access key** before saving the integration.

## Deploy Azure Resource Manager Template

<div style="margin: 30px 0">
<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fttsiothubintegration.blob.core.windows.net%2Fintegration-releases%2Flatest%2Fmain.json" target="_blank" class="ttui-btn ttui-btn--primary"       style="color: white;">Deploy template</a>
</div>

View template as [JSON](https://ttsiothubintegration.blob.core.windows.net/integration-releases/latest/main.json) or [Bicep](https://ttsiothubintegration.blob.core.windows.net/integration-releases/latest/main.bicep)

### Settings

The following parameters configure the integration:

- **Location**: The region in which the Azure resources will be deployed. Defaults to the region used by the selected Resource Group.
- **Name Suffix**: The suffix added to the Azure Resources. Defaults to a random string.
- **Stack Cluster Address**: The address of your {{% tts %}} deployment. Can be retrieved from the **Azure IoT** integration page in {{% tts %}} (see image above).
- **Stack Application ID**: The application ID of your application. Can be retrieved from the **Azure IoT** integration page in {{% tts %}} (see image above).
- **Stack API Key**: The application API key that you generated in the previous step.
- **Enable fallback route**: Defines if the Azure IoT Hub fallback route should be added. If enabled, uplink messages will be submitted to the default `events` endpoint in your Azure IoT Hub.
