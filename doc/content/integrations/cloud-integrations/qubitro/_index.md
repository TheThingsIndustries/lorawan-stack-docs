### Configure the decoder and verify the data

If you want to process incoming data, you need to configure decoder functions. You can create [custom decoder function](https://docs.qubitro.com/platform/functions/decoder/custom) or choose from available [device templates](https://docs.qubitro.com/platform/functions/decoder/template) on Qubitro Portal.

> **Note:** If the decoder is enabled on {{% tts %}}, Qubitro will automatically store incoming JSON data.

You can create a decoder function by navigating to the **Functions** tab located on the device page.

Then, navigate to the device and click on the **Data** tab to verify the incoming data.
