[ThingsBoard](https://thingsboard.io/) is an open-source IoT platform for data collection, processing, visualization, and device management. It supports cloud and on-premises deployments, and it combines scalability, fault-tolerance and performances to nullify the chances of getting your IoT data lost.

<!--more-->

The integration between {{% tts %}} and ThingsBoard is an example of an MQTT integration. ThingsBoard embeds an MQTT Broker, which is configured with the ThingsBoard **Integrations** functionality to subscribe or publish to {{% tts %}} [MQTT Server]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt" >}}).

## Prerequisites

1. Access to [ThingsBoard Professional Edition](https://thingsboard.io/products/thingsboard-pe/) deployment. You can [sign up](https://cloud.thingsboard.io/signup) for a trial account on ThingsBoard PE Cloud server.

{{< warning >}} Only ThingsBoard PE supports the **Platform Integrations** feature that is needed for this integration. {{</ warning >}}

## Configure {{% tts %}}

Before creating an integration setup on ThingsBoard, you need to prepare the uplink [payload formatter]({{< ref "/integrations/payload-formatters" >}}) on {{% tts %}}.

Define a [Javascript]({{< ref "/integrations/payload-formatters/javascript" >}}) payload formatter and take the following code as an example of the formatter parameter:

```js
function decodeUplink(input) {
  return {
    data: {
      temperature: input.bytes[0]
    }
  };
}
```

The payload formatter shown above extracts the first byte of your payload and sets it as a temperature value, but `data` object's contents can vary depending on the telemetry type your device is sending.

Also, note your credentials available under **MQTT** submenu of the **Integrations** menu on the left, because you will need them for further steps.

## Setup ThingsBoard

Log in to your ThingsBoard account. 

### Defining Data Converters 

Before creating an integration, you need to define uplink and downlink data converters. To do so, first navigate to **Data converters** on the left hand menu.

Click the **+** icon in the upper right and then select **Create new converter** to create a new uplink converter.

Give a **Name** to your uplink converter, select **Uplink** as a **Type** and paste the following code in the decoder function field:

```js
var data = decodeToJson(payload);
var deviceName = data.end_device_ids.device_id;
var deviceType = data.end_device_ids.application_ids.application_id;

var result = {
    deviceName: deviceName,
    deviceType: deviceType,
    telemetry: {
        temperature: data.uplink_message.decoded_payload.temperature
    }
};

function decodeToString(payload) {
    return String.fromCharCode.apply(String, payload);
}

function decodeToJson(payload) {
    var str = decodeToString(payload);
    var data = JSON.parse(str);
    return data;
}

return result;
```

You can test the decoder by clicking the **Test decoder function** and submitting an uplink message from {{% tts %}} manually.

Finish by selecting **Add**.

Follow the same procedure to create a converter with **Downlink** as a **Type** and a following encoder function:

```js
var data = {
        downlinks: [{
            f_port: 2,
            confirmed: false,
            frm_payload: btoa(msg.version),
            priority: "NORMAL"
        }]
    };

var result = {
    contentType: "JSON",
    data: JSON.stringify(data),
    metadata: {
        devId: 'device_id'     //enter your device's ID here
    }
};
return result;
```

Replace the `device_id` in the downlink converter function with the **End device ID** value from {{% tts %}}.

### Creating MQTT Integration

When you have defined data converters, navigate to the **Integrations** section on the left hand menu. Add a new integration by clicking the **+** button in the upper right corner.

Give a name to your integration by filling in the **Name** field. For **Type**, choose **The Things Stack**.

Make sure the **Enabled** and **Allow create devices or assets** checkboxes are left ticked.

For **Uplink data converter** and **Downlink data converter** choose the uplink and downlink converters you created in the previous step.

Depending on your {{% tts %}} deployment, choose **Host type**.

If you want to use TLS, enter `8883` for **Port**. Otherwise, enter `1883` and disable the **Enable SSL** button.

Use the credentials of your {{% tts %}} MQTT Server as **Username** and **Password**.

You can check the connection with your host via port you specified using credentials you provided by pressing the **Check connection** button. If it fails, make sure you fix it.

{{< figure src="creating-integration.png" alt="Creating the integration" >}}

Click the **Add** button on the bottom to finish creating the integration. 

A new device with your end device's ID will be created automatically. You can find it if you navigate to **Device groups &#8594; All** and search the end devices list. Select your device and switch to the **Latest telemetry** tab to see the telemetry data your device is sending, and use it to explore the further ThingsBoard features.

## Scheduling Downlinks

Besides listening to uplink messages, you can also schedule downlink messages to be sent to your end device from ThingsBoard.

This example shows the steps to create a setup that schedules a downlink message when the device attributes change. This requires modifying the **Root Rule Chain**. For more details, visit the [Getting Started with Rule Engine](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/re-getting-started/) section of the official ThingsBoard documentation page.

First, navigate to **Rule chains** on the left hand menu.

Open the **Root Rule Chain** by clicking the **Open rule chain** icon next to it.

In the nodes library on the left, find **integration downlink** node and place it on the dashboard. Give a **Name** to this node, choose the integration you created previously as **Integration** and click **Add** to finish.

{{< figure src="integration-downlink-node.png" alt="Adding integration downlink node" >}}

Connect the output port of the **Message Type Switch** node with the input port of the **integration downlink** node you just created, and choose **Attributes Updated** link label.

{{< figure src="adding-link.png" alt="Adding Attributes Updated link" >}}

Click **Apply changes** in the bottom right corner.

Go back to your device's settings by navigating to **Device groups &#8594; All** and selecting your device. 

Switch to the **Attributes** tab, choose **Shared attributes** in the **Entity attributes scope** list, then click the **+** in the upper right corner to add a new shared attribute.

Enter `version` in the **Key** field and `v.0.11` in the **String value** field. Click **Add** to finish.

{{< figure src="shared-attribute.png" alt="Shared attribute" >}}

By updating the **Value** of the shared attribute, you are scheduling a downlink message to be sent to your end device. To validate this, go to {{% tts %}} and find downlink message appearing in the **Live data** tab of your end device. The `frm_payload` attribute inside the `data` object of this message will contain Base64 encoded value of the shared attribute. For example, the `frm_payload` will be `di4wLjEx` for the shared attribute value `v.0.11`.
