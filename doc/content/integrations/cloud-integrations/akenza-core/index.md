## Prerequisites

1. A [user account on Akenza Core](https://auth.akenza.io/register).

## Setup Akenza Core

Log in to Akenza Core and navigate to the **Quick Start** tab in the **Environment** to see the steps to be taken to connect a device and manipulate the data coming from it.

Set up a domain by selecting the **Add Domain** button in the **Domains** submenu. 

Give a **Name** to your domain and choose **HTTP** for **Technology** to create a Webhook integration. The **Domain Secret** is auto-generated, while **Uplink Function** and **Downlink Function** may retain a **Passthrough** value. 

Select **Save** to finish.

After defining a domain and a device type, you can create a new device by selecting **Add Device** button in the **Inventory** submenu. 

Provide a **Name** for your device, select the previously created device type and domain, and do not forget to generate a **Device ID**.

The device you created can be found in the **Inventory** on the left hand menu.

Next step is to create a Webhook integration by instantiating the **Akenza Core** [Webhook template]({{< ref "/integrations/webhooks/webhook-templates" >}}).

Name your Webhook integration in the **Webhook ID** field. 

Fill in the **Domain Secret** and **Device ID** fields with domain secret and device ID values you generated previously on Akenza Core.

Finish with creating the integration by clicking the **Create akenza core webhook** button.

To see the values of all parameters of the Akenza Core integration, click on the integration after you created it with the Webhook template.

After creating the integration, go back to Akenza Core and you will be able to see the uplink messages in JSON format in your device's **Data** tab.
