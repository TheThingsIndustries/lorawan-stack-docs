[thethings.iO](https://thethings.io/) is hardware and connectivity agnostic enterprise IoT plaform that enables deploying scalable and flexible IoT solutions. This simple platform offers to quickly connect your IoT products using multiple protocols, APIs to manage them and dashboards to visualize the incoming data.

## Prerequisites

1. A [user account on thethings.iO](https://panel.thethings.io/#/register).

## Setup thethings.iO

Log in to your thethings.iO user account.

On the left hand menu, navigate to **Things**.

Click the **Create new IoT product** button. Give it a **Name**, choose **LoRa** as its format and finish with the **Create** button.

To parse the data coming from {{% tts %}}, we use thething.iO's [Cloud Code Function](https://developers.thethings.io/docs/cloud-code-functions).

On the left hand menu, navigate to **Cloud Code**. Since you have created a new LoRa product, a `lora_parser` Cloud Code Function is automatically generated for you - you can find it under **Functions**.

{{< figure src="cloud-code-function.png" alt="Auto-generated Cloud Code Function" >}}

To parse the data correctly, you need to modify this function according to the payload you are sending from {{% tts %}}. Checking [Data Formats](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/the-things-stack/concepts/data-formats/) in the the official {{% tts %}} documentation might be useful.

To modify the `lora_parser` function code, click the **Edit** button on its right. 

In the **Code** window, paste the following code, adjust it to your uplink data and click **Save**:

```js
function main(params, callback){
  var payload = params.payload.uplink_message.decoded_payload;
  var result = [
    {
      "key": "battery",
      "value": payload.battery
    }
  ]
  callback(null, result); 
}
```

Once you have created the product and the parser function, thethings.iO setup is ready. The next step will be creating the Webhook integration on {{% tts %}}. 

To complete the Webhook integration, you will need some information about the product you created in the previous steps. You can find the **Product ID** and its **Hash** in the **Details** window of the created product.

At this point, you can see that the API has not been called yet. Also, if you scroll down and check the **Things** section, you will see that your product does not have any things activated yet. After we complete the integration, a thing will be activated within your product, you will see the API calls and you will be able to visualize the incoming data!

## Configure {{% tts %}}

Next is to create a Webhook integration on {{% tts %}} by using **thethings.iO** [Webhook template]({{< ref "/integrations/webhooks/webhook-templates" >}}).

On {{% tts %}}, navigate to **Integrations &#8594; Webhooks** and choose **thethings.iO** Webhook template.

Name your integration by filling in the **Webhook ID** field. 

Paste the **Product ID** and **Hash** values from thethings.iO into the equally named fields of the Webhook template.

{{< figure src="thethingsio-webhook-integration.png" alt="Creating the Webhook integration" >}}

Hit the **Create thethings.io webhook** button to finish. 

To see the values of all parameters of the thethins.iO integration, click on the integration after you created it with the Webhook template. If you do this, you will see that the final callback URL has the following structure: `https://subscription.thethings.io/lora/{Product ID}/{Hash}?idname=end_device_ids.dev_eui`.

## Monitor Your Data

After you have created the Webhook integration on {{% tts %}}, you can monitor the incoming data on thethings.iO.

Go back to thethings.iO and navigate to your product's details page. 

In the **API calls** and the **Things sending data now** windows, you will see the incoming API calls.

If you scroll down, on the **Things** tab, you will see that now you have one activated thing! Click on its **Details** button on the right. 

{{< figure src="api-calls.png" alt="The incoming API calls" >}}

In the **Thing Details** section, scroll down to see the incoming data. Switch between marked buttons to see the data in numeric format, or as a real-time graph.
