This section explains how to configure a Pub/Sub integration using the built-in NATS client.

<!--more-->

Creating a Pub/Sub integration with NATS requires you to have a NATS server running with an available endpoint. See the [NATS Documentation](https://docs.nats.io/) for more information about configuring a NATS server.

No API key is needed for Pub/Sub messaging. All messages received by the Application Server are assumed to be authorized, so be sure to configure appropriate security on your NATS server.

In your application select the **Pub/Subs** submenu from the **Integrations** side menu. Clicking on the **+ Add Pub/Sub** button will open the Pub/Sub creation screen.

Give your Pub/Sub an **ID**, choose a **Pub/Sub format**, and enter a **Base topic** to subscribe or publish to.

Select **NATS** as provider.

If using TLS, enable **Secure**.

Enable **Use credentials** if your NATS server requires a login. Enter the username and password the Application Server should authenticate with.

Enter the endpoint of the NATS server in the **Address** field, and the port in the **Port** field.

## Message Types

The Application Server can be configured to publish and subscribe to topics for individual events. See [Message Types]({{< relref "../message-types" >}}) for more information about events and topics.

After enabling events, click the **Add Pub/Sub** button to enable the integration.

## Subscribing to Upstream Traffic

The Application Server publishes messages for any enabled events. For example, when a device sends an uplink, an `uplink` message is published. To view these using a `nats-sub` client connected to your NATS server:

```bash
nats-sub -s nats://<server_hostname>:<port> '>'
# Listening on [>]
# [#1] Received on [base-topic.uplink-subtopic] : '{"end_device_ids":{"device_id":"dev1","application_ids":{"application_id":"app1"}, "received_at":"2020-05-12T10:12:42.063941Z","uplink_message":{"session_key_id":"AXIDznz4bnQqtW8T3NsIVg==","f_port":1,"f_cnt":102,"frm_payload":"AQ=="}]}'
```

## Scheduling Downlinks

You can schedule downlink messages by publishing to a topic. For example, using a `nats-pub` client connected to your NATS server:

```bash
nats-pub -s nats://<server_hostname>:<port> base-topic.push-subtopic '{"end_device_ids":{"device_id":"dev1","application_ids":{"application_id":"app1"}},"downlinks":[{"f_port":1,"frm_payload":"AA==","priority":"NORMAL"}]}'
```

will push a downlink to the end device `dev1` of the application `app1` with a base64 encoded payload of `AA==`, if ```push-subtopic```is configured as the Sub topic for **Downlink queue push**.

This will also result in the following message being published by the Application Server:

```bash
# Received on [downlink-queued-subtopic] : 
'{"end_device_ids":{"device_id":"dev1","application_ids":{"application_id":"app1"}},"correlation_ids":["as:downlink:01DAVNFG65NAMC5DMX0GFJ8CSK"],"downlink_queued":{"f_port":1,"frm_payload":"AQ==","priority":"NORMAL","correlation_ids":["as:downlink:01DAVNFG65NAMC5DMX0GFJ8CSK"]}}'
```
