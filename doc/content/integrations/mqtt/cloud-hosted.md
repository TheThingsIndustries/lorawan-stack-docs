Cloud Hosted has special MQTT addressing to support multi tenancy. While most of the instructions in the [overview]({{< relref ".." >}}) apply, the following instructions are unique.

## MQTT Login Credentials

Login using an MQTT client with the application ID and tenant ID `app1@tenant1` as user name and your generated API key as password.

Replace all instances of username `app1` with username `app1@tenant`.

```bash
# Tip: when using `mosquitto_sub`, pass the `-d` flag to see the topics messages get published on.
# For example:

$ mosquitto_sub -h thethings.example.com -t "#" -u "app1@tenant1" -P "NNSXS.VEEBURF3KR77ZR.." -d
```

## Subscribing to Upstream Traffic

The Cloud Hosted application server publishes on the following topics:

- `v3/{application id}@{tenant id}/devices/{device id}/join`
- `v3/{application id}@{tenant id}/devices/{device id}/up`
- `v3/{application id}@{tenant id}/devices/{device id}/down/queued`
- `v3/{application id}@{tenant id}/devices/{device id}/down/sent`
- `v3/{application id}@{tenant id}/devices/{device id}/down/ack`
- `v3/{application id}@{tenant id}/devices/{device id}/down/nack`
- `v3/{application id}@{tenant id}/devices/{device id}/down/failed`
- `v3/{application id}@{tenant id}/devices/{device id}/service/data`
- `v3/{application id}@{tenant id}/devices/{device id}/location/solved`

With your MQTT client subscribed, when a device joins the network, a `join` message gets published. For example, for a device ID `dev1`, the message will be published on the topic `v3/app1@tenant1/devices/dev1/join`.

When the device sends an uplink message, a message will be published to the topic `v3/{application id}@{tenant id}/devices/{device id}/up`.

## Publishing Downlink Traffic

Downlinks can be scheduled on Cloud Hosted by publishing the message to the topic `v3/{application id}@{tenant id}/devices/{device id}/down/push`.

For example, to send an unconfirmed downlink message to the device `dev1` in application `app1` in tenant `tenant1` with the hexadecimal payload `BE EF` on `FPort` 15 with normal priority, use the topic `v3/app1@tenant1/devices/dev1/down/push` with the following contents:

For example, to send an unconfirmed downlink message to the device `dev1` in app `app1`:

```bash
# If you use `mosquitto_pub`, use the following command:
$ mosquitto_pub -h thethings.example.com \
  -t "v3/app1@tenant1/devices/dev1/down/push" \
  -u "app1@tenant1" -P "NNSXS.VEEBURF3KR77ZR.." \
  -m '{"downlinks":[{"f_port": 15,"frm_payload":"vu8=","priority": "NORMAL"}]}' \
  -d`
```

Once the downlink gets acknowledged, a message is published to the topic `v3/{application id}@{tenant id}/devices/{device id}/down/ack`.
