[MQTTBox](http://workswithweb.com/mqttbox.html) is a cross platform application that makes it simple to create MQTT clients, virtual device networks, and load test MQTT devices and brokers. 

<!--more-->

In this guide, we show how to create an MQTT client for subscribing or publishing to topics used by {{% tts %}} [MQTT Server]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt" >}}).

The examples in this guide are suitable for {{% tts %}} Open Source deployment. If you are using a different {{% tts %}} deployment, make sure your read a [Note on Using the tenant ID]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt#note-on-using-the-tenant-id" >}}).

## Prerequisites

1. [MQTTBox app](http://workswithweb.com/html/mqttbox/downloads.html) installed on your system.

## Configuring MQTTBox

This section follows the examples in the [MQTT Server]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt" >}}) guide.

In the MQTTBox application, click the **Create MQTT Client** button on the left to add a new MQTT client.

Give a name to your MQTT client by filling in the **MQTT Client Name** field.

Choose **mqtt / tcp** from the **Protocol** drop down list, and enter the **Public address** of your {{% tts %}} instance in the **Host** field.

Fill in the **Username** and **Password** fields.

Keep in mind that password represents the value of the authentication API key. For more info, see [Creating an API Key]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt#creating-an-api-key" >}}).

If you want to enable TLS for security, choose **mqtt / tls** as **Protocol** and use the **Public TLS address** of {{% tts %}} MQTT Server for **Host** instead. You will also have to upload at least the **CA file** associated with your {{% tts %}} deployment.

You may leave the other fields empty. Click **Save** to save the configuration.

If the MQTTBox client successfully connects to {{% tts %}} MQTT Server, the **Connected** status button will be visible in the upper right. You can also use this button do disconnect. 

Once connected, you can proceed with configuring the publishers or subscribers. 

You can add multiple MQTT clients, as well as multiple publishers and subscribers within those clients.

## Subscribe to Upstream Traffic

To listen to messages being sent by your device and published by the {{% tts %}} MQTT Server, select **Add subscriber** and fill in the **Topic to subscribe** field with the name of topic you wish to subscribe to.

In this section, we use the `v3/{application id}/devices/{device id}/up` topic structure for listening to uplink messages. 

See [Subscribing to Upstream Traffic]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt#subscribing-to-upstream-traffic" >}}) section of the MQTT Server guide for a list of available topics you can subscribe to.

Choose an appropriate **QoS** value from the list, click the **Subscribe** button and messages from {{% tts %}} will begin arriving shortly.

## Schedule Downlink Messages

To send messages to your end device, you need to schedule a downlink message as described in the [Publishing Downlink Traffic]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt#publishing-downlink-traffic" >}}) section of the MQTT Server guide. You can achieve this by adding and configuring a publisher in the MQTTBox application.

Fill in the **Topic to publish** field with `v3/{application id}/devices/{device id}/down/push` and replace the variables with their values from the {{% tts %}} Console.

See the [Publishing Downlink Traffic]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt#publishing-downlink-traffic" >}}) section to learn about using `/replace` instead of `/push`.

Choose an appropriate **QoS** value from the drop down menu.

You can define the payload in multiple formats. In this guide, we use the **Strings / JSON / XML / Characters** for **Payload Type**.

To send an example downlink, paste the following content in the **Payload** field:

```json
{
  "downlinks": [{
    "f_port": 15,
    "frm_payload": "vu8=",
    "priority": "NORMAL"
  }]
}
```

{{< note >}} For scheduling downlink messages, the `f_port` values from `1` to `233` are allowed. {{</ note >}}

Click the **Publish** button and a message with the hexadecimal payload `BE EF` will be scheduled for sending to your end device.
