[HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/) is an MQTT broker and a client based messaging platform which uses MQTT protocol for fast, reliable and efficient bi-directional data transfer to and from IoT devices. 

<!--more-->

HiveMQ provides its own client library, but it can be used with any MQTT compliant client library. It can be deployed on a private, hybrid or public cloud. You can integrate HiveMQ with existing enterprise systems thanks to its open API and a flexible extension framework.

HiveMQ also offers an open source tool called [MQTT CLI](https://github.com/hivemq/mqtt-cli), which provides a command line interface to interact with MQTT brokers. This tool can be used in a shell mode, allowing you to use multiple MQTT clients simultaneously. 

{{< note >}} HiveMQ broker is compliant with the MQTT 3.1, 3.1.1 and 5.0 protocol specifications, while the MQTT CLI tool supports 3.1.1 and 5.0 versions. {{</ note >}}

This guide contains the instructions to use HiveMQ CLI tool in a shell mode for subscribing and publishing to topics used by {{% tts %}} [MQTT Server]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt" >}}).

The examples in this guide are suitable for {{% tts %}} Open Source deployment. If you are using a different {{% tts %}} deployment, make sure your read a [Note on Using the tenant ID]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt#note-on-using-the-tenant-id" >}}).

## Prerequisites

1. [HiveMQ MQTT CLI](https://hivemq.github.io/mqtt-cli/docs/installation.html) installed on your system.

## Connecting to MQTT Server in MQTT CLI Shell Mode

Learn how to connect to {{% tts %}} MQTT Server by reading the [MQTT Server]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt" >}}) guide.

Enter the HiveMQ MQTT CLI shell mode by typing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mqtt shell
```

Once in shell mode, you can connect to {{% tts %}} MQTT Server by using the following command:

```bash
con -h <hostname> -p <port> -V 3 -u <username> -pw <password>
```

Keep in mind that `password` is the value of the authentication API key. For more info, see [Creating an API Key]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt#creating-an-api-key" >}}).

The `-V 3` flag is used here because the {{% tts %}} MQTT Server supports the 3.1.1 MQTT protocol version, as mentioned in the [MQTT Server guide]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt" >}}). For detailed descriptions of other parameters used with the `con` command, see the [official MQTT CLI documentation](https://hivemq.github.io/mqtt-cli/docs/shell/connect.html).

For example, you can connect to {{% tts %}} MQTT Server over its public address with the following command:

```bash
con -h "thethings.example.com" -p "1883" -V 3 -u "app1" -pw "NNSXS.VEEBURF3KR77ZR.."
```

To use TLS for additional security, change the port from `1883` to `8883` and use the `--cafile` option to provide the PEM encoded CA file of your {{% tts %}} deployment.

Once you have successfully connected to {{% tts %}} MQTT Server, continue with subscribing or publishing to topics exposed by it by following the sections below.

## Subscribe to Upstream Traffic

Use the `sub` command to subscribe to topics and listen to messages being sent from your end device. 

For example, if you want to listen to the uplink messages being sent from `dev1` device in `app1` application, use the following command:

```bash
sub -t "v3/app1/devices/dev1/up" -s
```

`-s` flag is used to subscribe with a context to the given topic, e.g. to stop the console being blocked by subscribing without a context. For detailed descriptions of all the available `sub` command parameters, see the [Subscribe](https://hivemq.github.io/mqtt-cli/docs/shell/subscribe.html) section of the HiveMQ MQTT CLI documentation.

See the [Subscribing to Upstream Traffic]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt#subscribing-to-upstream-traffic" >}}) section of the MQTT Server guide for a full list of available topics you can subscribe to.

## Schedule Downlink Messages

Use the `pub` command to publish to topics, e.g. to schedule downlink messages to be sent to your end device. 

For example, to push an unconfirmed downlink message with the hexadecimal payload `BE EF` on `FPort` 15 with normal priority to the `dev1` device, use the following command:

```bash
pub -t "v3/app1/devices/dev1/down/push" -m '{"downlinks":[{"f_port": 15,"frm_payload":"vu8=","priority": "NORMAL"}]}'
```

{{< note >}} For scheduling downlink messages, the `f_port` values from `1` to `233` are allowed. {{</ note >}}

For detailed descriptions of the `pub` command parameters, see the [Publish](https://hivemq.github.io/mqtt-cli/docs/shell/publish.html) section of the MQTT CLI documentation.

See the [Publishing Downlink Traffic]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt#publishing-downlink-traffic" >}}) section to learn about using `/replace` instead of `/push`.
