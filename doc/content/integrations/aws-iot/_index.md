## Custom IoT Core Settings {{< distributions-inline "Cloud" "Dedicated Cloud" "Enterprise" >}} {#custom-iot-core-settings}

Apart from the default integration which comes with a AWS CloudFormation template, you can also just let {{% tts %}} publish uplink messages and subscribe to downlink messages to AWS IoT Core. You can configure any AWS IoT Core endpoint, AWS access key, provide role-based access control (RBAC), configure the AWS IoT Core MQTT topic structure and which messages to publish.

## Application Server Telemetry {{< distributions-inline "Marketplace Launcher" >}} {#application-server-telemetry}

This is a simple integration that only supports publishing uplink messages and requires {{% tts %}} to run in your AWS account. This is typically only used for [AWS Marketplace AMI]({{< ref "/getting-started/aws/ami" >}}) deployments.
