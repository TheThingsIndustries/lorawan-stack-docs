## Adding Applications using the CLI

Create the first application:

```bash
$ ttn-lw-cli applications create app1 --user-id admin
```

This creates an application `app1` with the `admin` user as collaborator.

Next, see [Adding Integrations]({{< ref "/integrations/adding-integrations" >}}) to proceed with using the built-in [MQTT Server]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt" >}}) and [HTTP Webhooks]({{< ref "/integrations/webhooks" >}}) for receiving uplink and sending downlink traffic.

End devices are also created within applications. See [Adding Devices]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices" >}}) for more information.
