#### Adding Applications using the Console

In addition to the written instructions below, a video with instructions for adding an application is available on [The Things Network youtube channel](https://youtu.be/403yK_RaONE).

Go to **Applications** in the top menu, and click **+ Add Application** to reach the application registration page. Fill the application ID. The other fields are optional.

Click **Create Application** to create the application.

Your application will be created and you will be redirected to the application overview page of your newly created application.

#### Adding Applications using the CLI

Create the first application:

```bash
APP_ID="app1"
USER_ID="admin"
ttn-lw-cli applications create $APP_ID --user-id $USER_ID
```

This creates an application `app1` with the `admin` user as collaborator. Make sure to modify user parameters according to your setup.

###### Example

To create an application `my-test-app` on `thethings.example.com`, first create a JSON file named `req.json` in the same folder with the following example contents.

```json
{
  "application": {
    "ids": {
      "application_id": "my-test-app"
    },
    "name": "My Test Application",
    "description": "Application for my test devices",
    "network_server_address": "thethings.example.com",
    "application_server_address": "thethings.example.com",
    "join_server_address": "thethings.example.com"
  }
}
```

The request using `cURL` is as follows.

```bash
 curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
-d @./req.json \
 https://thethings.example.com/api/v3/users/testuser/applications
{"ids":{"application_id":"my-test-app"},"created_at":"2024-01-10T09:13:34.817772Z","updated_at":"2024-01-10T09:13:34.817773Z","name":"My Test Application","description":"Application for my test devices","administrative_contact":{"user_ids":{"user_id":"testuser"}},"technical_contact":{"user_ids":{"user_id":"testuser"}},"network_server_address":"thethings.example.com","application_server_address":"thethings.example.com","join_server_address":"thethings.example.com"}
```

Next, see [Adding Integrations]({{< ref "/integrations/adding-integrations" >}}) to proceed with using the built-in [MQTT Server]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt" >}}) and [HTTP Webhooks]({{< ref "/integrations/webhooks" >}}) for receiving uplink and sending downlink traffic.

End devices are also created within applications. See [Adding Devices]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices" >}}) for more information.

## Create Application API Key

Some applications require an API Key to write downlink traffic, read uplink traffic, manage integrations, etc. In this section we explain how to create an application API key on some basic examples, but this procedure is identical for any other right as well.

{{< tabs/container "Console" "CLI" "HTTP (REST) API">}}

{{< tabs/tab "Console" >}}

To create an API key for your application, navigate to **API Keys** on the left hand menu of your application's settings and select **Add API Key**.

Enter a **Name** for your key, set the **Expiry date**, select rights that you want to grant and then press **Create API Key**.

{{< figure src="application-api-key-creation.png" alt="Application API Key creation" >}}

You will see a screen that shows your newly created API Key. You now can copy it in your clipboard by pressing the copy button. After saving the key in a safe place, press **I have copied the key**. You will not be able to see this key again in the future, and if you lose it, you can create a new one by following this same procedure.

{{< figure src="application-api-key-created.png" alt="Application API Key created" >}}

{{< /tabs/tab >}}

{{< tabs/tab "CLI" >}}

To create an API key for your application with a **Delete application** right:

```bash
API_KEY_NAME="API key for deleting my application"
ttn-lw-cli applications api-keys create \
  --name $API_KEY_NAME \
  --application-id $APP_ID \
  --right-application-delete
```

The CLI will return an API key such as `NNSXS.RLA7AGGMD5ZHBH...`. This API key has only delete rights and can therefore only be used for deleting this application. Make sure to copy the key and save it in a safe place. You will not be able to see this key again in the future, and if you lose it, you can create a new one by following this same procedure.

See the [CLI Reference]({{< ref "/ttn-lw-cli/ttn-lw-cli_applications_api-keys" >}}) for details on managing application API keys using the CLI.

###### Example

To create an API Key for the application `my-test-app` on `thethings.example.com`, first create a JSON file named `req.json` in the same folder with the following example contents.

## Payload Encryption and Decryption

LoRaWANÂ® frames are encrypted and decrypted on the application layer using the AppSKey by default.

Once the application is created, you can update your application settings to skip uplink payload decryption and downlink payload encryption. This will cause the Application Server to forward messages to integrations without any processing, for example it will neglect [payload formatters]({{< ref "/integrations/payload-formatters" >}}), meaning the integrations will be responsible for decrypting uplink messages in order to understand them. Also, scheduling downlinks from {{% tts %}} will be restricted, as it is expected for downlinks in that case to be scheduled from integrations.

To configure this setting, navigate to your applications's **General settings** tab in the Console and check the **Enabled** box under **Skip payload encryption and decryption** section.

{{< note >}} The **Skip payload encryption and decryption** setting requires that the Application Server cannot access the AppSKey and can be used exclusively with external join servers (such as The Things Join Server with a custom KEK or the Semtech Join Server) that encrypt the AppSKey with their own KEK. Using this setting with a cluster local Join Server will not have any effect, because the Application Sever automatically unwraps keys so this setting gets overridden. {{</ note >}}
