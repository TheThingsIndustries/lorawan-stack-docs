The [{{% lbs %}}](https://lora-developers.semtech.com/resources/tools/lora-basics/lora-basics-for-gateways/) protocol simplifies management of large scale LoRaWAN® networks. {{% lbs %}} is the preferred way of connecting Gateways to {{% tts %}}.

This section contains information for connecting your gateway to {{% tts %}} using {{% lbs %}} and its subprotocols.

These are general instructions for all {{% lbs %}} gateways. For specific instructions for your gateway, look in the [Gateways]({{< ref "gateways" >}}) section.

## Advantages of {{% lbs %}}

Some of the advantages of {{% lbs %}} over the legacy UDP Packet Forwarder are:

- Centralized Update and Configuration Management
- TLS and Token-based Authentication
- Centralized Channel-Plan Management
- No Dependency on Local Time Keeping

## Authentication

{{% tts %}} supports [TLS server authentication and client token](https://lora-developers.semtech.com/build/software/lora-basics/lora-basics-for-gateways/?url=authmodes.html). This requires a `*.trust` file and a `*.key` file. See the [LNS]({{< relref "lns" >}}) and [CUPS]({{< relref "cups" >}}) sections for information about getting these files. {{% tts %}} does not support TLS client authentication and does not provide a `*.cert` file.

## LNS and CUPS Sub Protocols

{{% lbs %}} contains two sub protocols for connecting Gateways to Network Servers, LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS) and Configuration and Update Server (CUPS).

### LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS)

LNS establishes a data connection between a {{% lbs %}} gateway and a Network Server (in this case, {{% tts %}}). LoRa® uplink and downlink frames are exchanged through this data connection. The LNS protocol is **required** for sending and receiving LoRaWAN data.

### Configuration and Update Server (CUPS)

CUPS allows a Network Server to configure gateways remotely, and to update gateway firmware. CUPS is **not required** for sending and receiving LoRaWAN data, but it can greatly simplify the management of gateways. Configuring CUPS will also automatically retrieve LNS credentials and configure LNS on your gateway.
