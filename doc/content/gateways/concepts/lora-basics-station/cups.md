{{% lbs %}} can regularly connect to a {{% cups %}} (CUPS) server to check for configuration and software updates. This page contains information about connecting your gateway to {{% tts %}} to support remote management via the CUPS Protocol.

<!--more-->

{{< warning >}} Configuring CUPS automatically retrieves LNS credentials and configures LNS on your gateway. If you configure CUPS, your gateway will override LNS credentials in case of successful CUPS connection. {{</ warning >}}

## Requirements

1. User account on {{% tts %}} with rights to create gateways.
2. A gateway which supports {{% lbs %}}.

## Create a Gateway

To connect a gateway using the CUPS protocol, you must first add the gateway in {{% tts %}}. This can be done either in the console, or via the command line. See instructions for [Adding Gateways]({{< ref "/gateways/concepts/adding-gateways" >}}). 

## Create Separate CUPS and LNS API Keys

Since CUPS automatically configures LNS, you will need two API keys.

CUPS requires an API key for your gateway with the following rights:

- View gateway information
- Edit basic gateway settings
- Retrieve secrets associated with a gateway

{{< figure src="../cups-rights.png" alt="CUPS API Key Rights" >}}

LNS requires an API Key with the following rights:

- Link as Gateway to a Gateway Server for traffic exchange, i.e. write uplink and read downlink

{{< figure src="../lns-rights.png" alt="LNS API Key Rights" >}}

To create these API keys for your gateway, follow instructions for [Creating a Gateway API key]({{< ref "/gateways/concepts/adding-gateways#create-gateway-api-key" >}}).

## Configure CUPS to Send the LNS API Key

{{< tabs/container "Console" "CLI" >}}

{{< tabs/tab "Console" >}}

We need to configure CUPS in {{% tts %}} to transmit the LNS API key when a gateway connects. To do so in the Console, go to the **General Settings** page of your gateway.

In the **LoRa Basics Station LNS Authentication Key** field, paste the [LNS API key]({{< ref "/gateways/concepts/lora-basics-station/cups#create-separate-cups-and-lns-api-keys" >}}) you generated in the previous step.

{{< figure src="../lns-key.png" alt="LoRa Basics Station LNS Authentication Key" >}}

Press **Save Changes** to update the gateway settings. When your gateway connects to CUPS, {{% tts %}} will send the LNS configuration settings and API key.

{{</ tabs/tab >}}

{{< tabs/tab "CLI" >}}

We need to configure CUPS in {{% tts %}} to transmit the LNS API key when a gateway connects. Use the following command to do so, replacing `"your-gateway-id"` with your gateway ID in {{% tts %}} and  `"your-lns-api-key"` with the [LNS API key]({{< ref "/gateways/concepts/lora-basics-station/cups#create-separate-cups-and-lns-api-keys" >}}) you created in the last step:

```bash
GTW_ID="your-gateway-id"
LNS_KEY="your-lns-api-key"
SECRET=$(echo -n $LNS_KEY | xxd -ps -u -c 8192)
ttn-lw-cli gateways update $GTW_ID --lbs-lns-secret.value $SECRET
```

{{< note >}}If you receive an error running `ttn-lw-cli gateways update`, you may need to update the CLI. See instructions in [Installing the CLI]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/interact/cli/installing-cli" >}}).{{</ note >}}

If successful, you should receive a response as follows:

<details>
<summary>Show CLI output</summary>

```json
{
  "ids": {
    "gateway_id": "<gateway-id>"
  },
  "created_at": "2020-10-13T10:49:02.730Z",
  "updated_at": "2020-11-17T14:52:06.440Z",
  "version_ids": {

  },
  "lbs_lns_secret": {
    "key_id": "is/gateway-secrets-encryption-key",
    "value": "<encrpyted-base64-lns-api-key>"
  }
}
```
</details>

## Configure Gateway

All {{% lbs %}} gateways support the following configuration options. Consult your gateway documentation for more information about configuring your specific gateway. 

### CUPS Server Address

The server address is the network endpoint of {{% tts %}} CUPS. It is a combination of the **protocol** (https), the **server address**, and the **port**.

Enter the following in your gateway as CUPS Server Address: `https://<server-address>:443`. 

The `<server-address>` is the address of your {{% tts %}} deployment. See [Server Addresses]({{< ref "the-things-stack/concepts/server-addresses" >}}) for more info.

### CUPS Server Certificate / CUPS Trust

This is the [CA certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) which secures your domain. A `.pem` file containing common certificates is available in the [Root Certificates Reference]({{< ref "/reference/root-certificates" >}}).

Upload the `.pem` file in your gateway as the CUPS Server Certificate, i.e. CUPS Trust.

### CUPS Key File

This is a file which {{% tts %}} uses to verify the identity of your gateway.

Instructions below show how to create a file called `cups.key`, replacing `"your-cups-api-key"` with the [CUPS API key]({{< ref "/gateways/concepts/lora-basics-station/cups#create-separate-cups-and-lns-api-keys" >}}) you created above.

On Linux or macOS use the following commands:

```bash
CUPS_KEY="your-cups-api-key"
echo "Authorization: Bearer $CUPS_KEY" | perl -p -e 's/\r\n|\n|\r/\r\n/g'  > cups.key
```

On Windows, you can use Command Prompt:

```bash
set CUPS_KEY=your-cups-api-key
echo Authorization: Bearer %CUPS_KEY% > cups.key
```

or PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:CUPS_KEY='your-cups-api-key'
write-output "Authorization: Bearer $env:CUPS_KEY" | set-content cups.key
```

The commands above create a file called `cups.key`, terminated with a Carriage Return Line Feed (`0x0D0A`) character. Upload this file in your gateway as the CUPS key.

If the connection is successful, the CUPS server will send the LNS Server Address, LNS Trust and the LNS API Key to the gateway and it will automatically attempt to connect to the LNS Server.
