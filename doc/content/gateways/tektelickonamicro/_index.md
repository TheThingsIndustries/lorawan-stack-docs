Tektelic Kona Micro IoT LoRaWAN Gateway is an 8 channel LoRaWAN gateway, whose technical specifications can be found in [the official documentation](https://tektelic.com/catalog/kona-micro-iot-gateway).

## Prerequisites

1. User account on {{% tts %}} with rights to create Gateways.
2. Tektelic Kona Micro IoT LoRaWAN Gateway with BSP version 3.x.x, connected to the Internet via ethernet.

## Registration

Create a gateway by following the instructions for [Adding Gateways]({{< ref "/gateways/adding-gateways" >}}). The **EUI** of the gateway can be found on the back panel of the gateway under the field **GW ID**.

## Connect to the Gateway

To be able to configure your gateway to connect to {{% tts %}}, you first need to connect to the gateway itself. There are two ways you can connect to the Tektelic Kona Micro gateway - using the [KonaFT tool](https://support.tektelic.com/portal/en/kb/articles/konaft) and via SSH.

### Using KonaFT Tool

{{< note >}} KonaFT application can be installed on Windows OS only, and supports connecting to {{% tts %}} using {{% udp-pf %}} only. {{</ note >}}

**Step 1:** Download the [KonaFT application](https://support.tektelic.com/portal/en/kb/articles/konaft) and complete the installation.

**Step 2:** Connect your gateway to the KonaFT tool. [See **KFT_Connect** video instructions](https://support.tektelic.com/portal/en/kb/articles/konaft-instructional-videos)

**Step 3:** [Assign a static IP address to the gateway using KonaFT](https://support.tektelic.com/portal/en/kb/articles/assigning-static-ip-to-kona-gateway-using-konaft).

**Step 4:** Configure the gateway to connect to {{% tts %}} using [{{% udp-pf %}}]({{< relref "udp" >}}).

### SSH into the Gateway

Find the gateway's IP address. This can be done in various ways. You can connect your machine to the same local network as that of the gateway ethernet connection and scan for open SSH ports, or assign a static IP to the gateway and use that one.

Once the gateway IP address is found, SSH into it with the following command:

```bash
$ ssh root@<GatewayIP>
```

The password for the **root** user can be found on the back panel of the gateway. It is typically a 9 character alphanumeric string starting with **1846XXXXX**.

## Connecting the Gateway to {{% tts %}}

The Tektelic Kona Micro supports {{% lbs %}} and the legacy {{% udp-pf %}}. 

{{% lbs %}} is more secure and supports configuration of custom channel plans, amongst other improvements, so please follow instructions for [connecting the Tektelic Kona Micro with {{% lbs %}}]({{< relref "lbs" >}}).

If for some reason {{% lbs %}} is not available to you, follow instructions for [connecting with the {{% udp-pf %}}]({{< relref "udp" >}}).
