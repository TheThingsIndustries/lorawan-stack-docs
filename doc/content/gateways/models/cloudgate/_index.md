Option Wireless Technology’s CloudGate is the carrier-approved IoT solution platform that delivers device connectivity, security and processing power for global IoT applications.

This guide will help you set up the CloudGate gateway to communicate over {{% tts %}} using [LoRa Basics Station]({{< ref "/gateways/concepts/lora-basics-station" >}}).

For more information, see [CloudGate Universe documentation](https://cloudgateuniverse.com/docs/cloudgate-universe-guide) site (free login required to access).

## Prerequisites

1. User account on {{% tts %}} with rights to create Gateways.
2. CloudGate Gateway with firmware version `2.96.0` or newer, connected to Internet via Ethernet or LTE. 
3. CG2132 LoRa expansion card installed in to the CloudGate. 

## CloudGate Setup

For the first-time hardware and software setup, you can refer to the appropriate configuration guide on the [CloudGate Universe documentation](https://cloudgateuniverse.com/docs/cloudgate-user-guide) page. Here, we have included a few short steps to help you to get started.

### Connect the CloudGate to the Internet via Ethernet 

Connect an Ethernet cable to the WAN port of the CloudGate gateway. The WAN port supports DHCP and should automatically obtain an IP address from the network.

### Connect the CloudGate to the Internet via LTE
  
{{< figure src="Insert-SIM.jpeg" alt="Insert SIM" class="float" >}}

Install the LoRa expansion card into the CloudGate gateway.
  
Attach the appropriate antennas to the antenna connectors on the front of the device. The right SMA connector is for the main antenna, and the left SMA connector is for the GPS/diversity antenna.
   
Install the micro-SIM card by removing the plate on the back side of the CloudGate. Insert the micro SIM into the slot as shown in the picture on the right.

### Connect your PC to the CloudGate

Power on the CloudGate by plugging in the 12VDC power supply. The boot process takes about 120 seconds.
   
Connect one side of an Ethernet cable to the LAN port of the CloudGate, and the other side to your PC. The CloudGate runs a built-in DHCP server, so it will provide your PC with an IP address in the `192.168.1.x` range.
   
Now, open a web browser and navigate to to `192.168.1.1`.
   
Log in using `admin` as both a username and a password. It is highly recommended to change the default username and password. This can be done in the settings under the **System** tab.

Navigate to the **Home** tab and check if the CloudGate is connected.

{{< figure src="Connection-status.png" alt="Connection status" >}}  
 
 In case the CloudGate is not connected yet and you are connecting it via LTE network, check if the SIM PIN is entered correctly or if the correct APN parameters are used in the **Network Settings** section (under the **Connections &#8594; LTE Interface** tab).
  
{{< figure src="Network-settings.png" alt="Network settings" >}}

On the other hand, if you are connecting it via Ethernet, check if the CloudGate has obtained an IP address in the **Connections &#8594; Main Ethernet Interface** tab.

As soon as the CloudGate is connected to the Internet, it will perform a check-in on the [CloudGate Universe](https://cloudgateuniverse.com), and it will start downloading and installing the latest software. You will see the LEDs move in a Knight Rider-like sequence during download and installation.

After the installation is complete, the CloudGate will reboot. This takes approximately 2 minutes to complete.

Go to **Home &#8594; System Information** and make sure that the **Basics Station** application is installed in the CloudGate.

{{< note >}} The Basics Station application works only for CG2132 and CG8102 [LoRa cards](https://cloudgateuniverse.com/docs/lora-card-family). {{</ note >}}

## Connect the CloudGate to {{% tts %}}

### Registration

Create a gateway by following the instructions for [Adding Gateways]({{< ref "/gateways/concepts/adding-gateways" >}}).

The Gateway EUI is the MAC address of the CloudGate with `FFFE` in the middle. For example, if the gateway's MAC address is `1234567890AB`, the Gateway EUI is `123456FFFE7890AB`.

### Create an API key

LNS establishes a data connection between a LoRa Basics Station and {{% tts %}}. To connect a gateway using the LNS protocol, it requires an API Key.

Navigate to the **API Keys** on the left hand menu in your gateway's settings on {{% tts %}} and select **Add API Key**. 

Enter a name for your key, select the **Link as Gateway to a Gateway Server for traffic exchange, i.e. write uplink and read downlink** right and then press **Create API Key**.

{{< figure src="Create-API-Key.png" alt="Create API key" >}}

You will see a screen that shows your newly created API Key. You now can copy it in your clipboard by pressing the copy button. After saving the key in a safe place, press **I have copied the key**. 

### Configure Basics Station

We assume you have made sure that the Basics Station application is installed in your CloudGate as noted in the previous steps.

Now, go to **Plugins &#8594; Basic Station**.

{{< figure src="Open-BasicsStation.png" alt="Open Basics Station" >}}

Configure the authentication as **LNS**, and select the region.

{{< figure src="BasicsStation-Config-Authentication.png" alt="Choose Authentication Field" >}}

On CloudGate gateways, only CUPS or LNS can be configured. Configuring CUPS will automatically configure LNS, so to use {{% tts %}}, just follow the instructions for [Connecting to CUPS]({{< ref "/gateways/concepts/lora-basics-station/cups" >}}).

The server address is the network endpoint of {{% tts %}} LNS. It is a combination of the **protocol** (wss), the **server address**, and the **port**. Enter the following in your gateway as the **LNS Server Address**: `wss://<server-address>:8887`.

The server CA certificates can be found from [Root Certificates]({{< ref "/reference/root-certificates" >}}) page.

You can download the minimal certificates list, and then copy and paste the content into the **Server CA Cert** field.

{{< figure src="BasicsStation-Config-ServerCACert.png" alt="Add Server CA Certificate" >}}

The **Gateway Cert** field must be left empty.

In the **Gateway Key** field, enter the LNS API key you created during previous steps. The format should be `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>`. Click on **Save Changes** to finish.

{{< figure src="BasicsStation-Config-GatewayKey.png" alt=" Enter Gateway Key" >}}

If your configuration was successful, your gateway will connect to {{% tts %}} after a couple of seconds!
