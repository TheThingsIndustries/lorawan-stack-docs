## Registration

Create a gateway by following the instructions for the [Console]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/interact/console#create-gateway" >}}) or the [CLI]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/interact/cli#create-gateway" >}}).

The **EUI** of the gateway can be found on the configuration web page of the gateway as **Gateway ID**, or on the bottom label as **DevEUI**.

## Configuration via Browser

The Laird Sentrius™ RG1xx LoRaWAN Gateway features a Wi-Fi quick config that allows you to configure it without connecting via ethernet. To expose the Wi-Fi access point, do the following:

1. Depress and hold the user button for 7 seconds.
2. From a wirelessly enabled device perform a scan.
3. Connect to the access point rg1xx29378B, where “29378B” are the last six digits of the Ethernet MAC address found on the label on the bottom of the gateway.

The network is secured with WPA2 with a password that is the same as the SSID.  It is recommended that the default password is changed for security reasons.  The password can be changed on the **Wi-Fi > Advanced** web page.
