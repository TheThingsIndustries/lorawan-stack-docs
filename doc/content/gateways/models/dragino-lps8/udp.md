This section contains instructions for connecting the Dragino LPS8N LoRaWANÂ® gateway to {{% tts %}} using the [{{% udp-pf %}}]({{< ref "/gateways/concepts/udp" >}}).

<!--more-->

Before proceeding with the next step, we assume you have set up internet access for the LPS8N using one of the following methods:

- Using the WAN port of the LPS8N
- As a WiFi client
- Using the built-in 4G modem

On the Web UI, navigate to **LoRaWAN > LoRaWAN** in the menu.

On the LoRaWAN Configuration page, configure the following settings:

1. **Service Provider**: `The Things Network V3`
2. **Server Address**: `eu1.cloud.thethings.network`
3. **Gateway ID**: This is the default Gateway EUI for LPS8N. You can keep it as is.
4. **Uplink Port**: `1700`
5. **Downlink Port**: `1700`

Copy the **Gateway ID** which you will need in the next step.
{{< note "The LPS8N Web UI refers to Gateway EUI as the Gateway ID, which is the Gateway EUI for {{% tts %}}." />}}

Select **Save & Apply**.
