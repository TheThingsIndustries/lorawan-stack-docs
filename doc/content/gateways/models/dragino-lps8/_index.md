The [Dragino LPS8N](https://www.dragino.com/products/lora-lorawan-gateway/item/200-lps8n.html/) is a LoRaWAN® indoor gateway based on the open-source OpenWrt Linux operating system. Its hardware is built around the SX1302 LoRa Core™ Digital Baseband Chip and the SX1250 LoRa Core™ Multi-band Sub-GHz RF Front End. The LPS8N provides ten programmable parallel demodulation paths. The gateway can be connected to the internet using Ethernet, WiFi, or optional Cellular (3G/4G) connectivity. It supports the EU868, IN865, US915, AU915, AS923, and KR920 frequency bands.

This page guides you on how to configure the Dragino LPS8N for adding on {{% tts %}}.

## Prerequisites

1. A user account on {{% tts %}} with user rights to add gateways.
2. A computer on the same network as the LPS8N.
3. The latest version of firmware running on the Dragino LPS8N. Read the Dragino LPS8N [user manual](http://wiki.dragino.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/User%20Manual%20for%20All%20Gateway%20models/LPS8N%20-%20LoRaWAN%20Gateway%20User%20Manual/#H8.A0UpgradeLinuxFirmware) for instructions on firmware upgrade.


## Configuring the LPS8N

Navigate to the Web UI using one of the following addresses with a web browser:

- If you are connecting through the Wi-Fi access point generated by the LPS8N, use the default IP address `10.130.1.1`.
- If your LPS8N is connected to a router via Ethernet or Wi-Fi, use the address `http://IP_ADDRESS` or `http://IP_ADDRESS:8000`. Replace `IP_ADDRESS` with the IP address assigned to the LPS8N by the router.

When prompted for the sign-in, enter the username `root` and the password `dragino`.

After signing in, you will be directed to the LPS8N's Web UI.

Before proceeding with the next step, we assume you have set up internet access for the LPS8N using one of the following methods:

- Using the WAN port of the LPS8N
- As a WiFi client
- Using the built-in 4G modem

On the Web UI, navigate to **LoRaWAN > LoRaWAN** in the menu.

On the LoRaWAN Configuration page, configure the following settings:

1. **Service Provider**: `The Things Network V3`
2. **Server Address**: `eu1.cloud.thethings.network`
3. **Gateway ID**: This is the default Gateway EUI for LPS8N. You can keep it as is.
4. **Uplink Port**: `1700`
5. **Downlink Port**: `1700`

Copy the **Gateway ID** which you will need in the next step.
{{< note "The LPS8N Web UI refers to Gateway EUI as the Gateway ID, which is the Gateway EUI for {{% tts %}}." />}}

Select **Save & Apply**.

## Adding LPS8N to {{% tts %}}

You can add the LPS8N gateway to {{% tts %}} by following the instructions on the [ Adding Gateways]({{< ref "/gateways/concepts/adding-gateways" >}}) page. The **Gateway EUI** should be the **Gateway ID** that you have copied from the LPS8N's Web UI.
