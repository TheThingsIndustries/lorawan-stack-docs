This page guides you on how to connect the Dragino LPS8 to {{% tts %}}.

## Prerequisites

1. A user account on {{% tts %}} with user rights to add gateways.
2. An LPS8 connected to the internet.
3. A computer on the same network as the LPS8.
4. The latest version of firmware running on the Dragino LPS8 (read the Dragino LPS8 [user manual](https://www.dragino.com/downloads/downloads/LoRa_Gateway/LPS8/LPS8_LoRaWAN_Gateway_User_Manual_v1.2.0.pdf) for instructions on firmware upgrade).

## Register the Gateway on {{% tts %}}

Create a gateway by following [the instructions]({{< ref "/gateways/adding-gateways" >}}). The Gateway EUI can be derived from the WiFi MAC address that can be found on the back of the gateway enclosure. To get the 8 byte Gateway EUI insert `4150` at the end of the WiFi MAC address.
 
If the WiFi MAC address is `A8:A8:41:A8:CE:54` then the Gateway EUI is `A8 A8 41 A8 CE 54 41 50`.
