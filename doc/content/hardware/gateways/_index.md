This section contains information to help you work with gateways in {{% tts %}}.

<!--more-->

Here, you'll find guides for connecting gateways using {{% lbs %}} or the {{% udp-pf %}}, and instructions for connecting many popular LoRaWANÂ® gateways.
If your {{% tts %}} deployment is connected to [Packet Broker]({{< ref "/concepts/packet-broker" >}}), you can take advantage of coverage from The Things Network without adding any gateways of your own. See [Adding Gateways]({{< relref "concepts/adding-gateways" >}}) for instructions to add gateways and to find out if your location has nearby gateways.
