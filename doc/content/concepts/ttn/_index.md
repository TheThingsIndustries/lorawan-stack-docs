{{% ttss %}} (run by The Things Industries) is a free and limited version of The Things Stack _without any guarantees or SLA_ available to The Things Network community for non-commercial, small scale testing and experimentation.

{{% ttss %}} currently has the following clusters:

| **Cluster ID** | **Name**        | **Location**      |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| `au1`          | Australia 1     | Sydney, Australia |
| `eu1`          | Europe 1        | Ireland           |
| `nam1`         | North America 1 | California, USA   |

If you navigate to [this link](https://console.cloud.thethings.network), you can find out which {{% ttss %}} clusters are recommended for your deployment based on the location of your devices and immediately log into its Console.

[The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) is a global collaborative Internet of Things ecosystem that creates networks, devices and solutions using LoRaWAN.

The Things Network runs {{% ttss %}}, which is a crowdsourced, open and decentralized LoRaWANÂ® network. This network is a great way to get started testing devices, applications, and integrations, and get familiar with LoRaWAN.
