## User Not Found

This error arises when an unregistered user tries to change the password in {{% tts %}} Console, i.e. when a user is using a bad User ID.

If you are facing this error, you should first double check the User ID that you are using. If you are sure that you are using the correct User ID, you need to contact your admin because this user might be deleted. If this is the case, the User ID gets purged, after which you can register as a new user with the same User ID.

## Invalid Credentials / Incorrect Password or User ID

You will encounter these errors if using a wrong User ID/Username/Email and/or Password when logging into {{% tts %}} Console with credentials or The Things ID.

Please double check your User ID and Password. Try changing your Password. If the problem persists, your User ID might be deleted, so contact your admin to purge it.
