### Added

- New `SearchAccounts` RPC on the `EntityRegistrySearch` service.
- Prompt user to confirm navigation when changes have not been saved in the payload formatter form to prevent big change-drafts from getting lost.

  - Support for the field mask setup was added for both CLI and Console.
- OpenID Connect identity providers which provide the `email_verified` field of the claims token as a string are now supported.
  - String value parsing is based on [strconv.ParseBool](https://pkg.go.dev/strconv#ParseBool).

### Changed

### Fixed

- CLI command `end-device template create` no longer breaks when providing field mask values.
- Device repository services no longer require ApplicationID in its request URL.
- Importing ABP devices via the CSV format now correctly handles the missing session key ID.
