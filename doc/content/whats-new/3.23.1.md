### Added

- Automatic email notifications for entity limits, this is triggered by restrictions on the `user`, `tenant` or `license`. The recipient of these emails are determined by the type of restriction that triggered it.
- List of end-devices can now be sorted by `last_seen_at` field. Unseen devices will be shown last.

### Fixed

- It is now allowed to set `0` for ping slot frequency and beacon frequency in the Network Layer Settings of the end device general settings in the Console.
- MAC parameters that have the `desired_` will be hidden from the end device general settings for multicast end devices in the Console.
