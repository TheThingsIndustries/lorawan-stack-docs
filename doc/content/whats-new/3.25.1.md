### Added

- Fallback end device version identifiers to be used while importing end devices using the Console.

### Changed

- The Things Stack is now built with Go 1.20.

### Deprecated

- `--with-claim-authentication-code` flag for the end device `create` command via the CLI. Users must use a valid claim authentication code that is registered on a Join Server instead of generating one during end device creation.

### Fixed

- Attempting to claim an end device with a generated DevEUI will now result in an error.
- Claiming an end device using command line flags.
- 24 hour stack components deadlock when the default clustering mode is used.
