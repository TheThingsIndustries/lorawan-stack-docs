### Added

- The `is.gormstore` experimental flag has been added. Swaps the underlying Identity Server store implementation if set to true.
- The Things Join Server 2.0 (type `ttjsv2`) for claiming with Device Claiming Server.
- All Join Servers with a `/64` JoinEUI prefix are contacted concurrently with LoRaWAN Backend Interfaces interoperability. This should only be used with ambiguous JoinEUIs and when migrating Join Servers.

### Changed

- Class B and C downlinks will no longer be automatically retried indefinitely if none of the gateways are available at the scheduling moment, and the downlink paths come from the last uplink.
  - This was already the behavior for downlinks which had their downlink path provided explicitly using the `class_b_c.gateways` field.
  - The downlinks will be evicted from the downlink queue and a downlink failure event will be generated. The failure event can be observed by the application using the `downlink_failed` message, which is available in all integrations.
- Event history and payload storage TTL has now 1% jitter.
- The underlying store implementation has been changed to be by default based on `bun` instead of `gorm`. The previous store implementation can be reactivated using the `is.gormstore` experimental flag.

### Deprecated

- The Things Join Server 1.0 (type `ttjs`) for claiming with Device Claiming Server. Use The Things Join Server 2.0 (type `ttjsv2`) instead.
