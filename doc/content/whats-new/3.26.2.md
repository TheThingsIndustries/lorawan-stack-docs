### Added

- New Admin Panel in the Console.

### Fixed

- The Console contacting the NOC configuration endpoint indefinitely.
- Network Operations Center button for end devices in the end device overview not working in the Console.
- Removing user invitations not working in the user management panel for administrators.
- Fix payload formatter page launching malformed requests in the Console.
- Fix end device claiming issues in the Console and improve error messaging.
- HTTP API routes for parsing QR codes for the QR Generator service. We exercise our right to break compatibility with third party HTTP clients since this is a bug.
  - `/qr-code/end-devices/parse` is changed to `/qr-codes/end-devices/parse`.
  - `/qr-code/end-devices/{format_id}/parse` is changed to `/qr-codes/end-devices/{format_id}/parse`.
- Fixed authenticating with Packet Broker when gRPC dialer schemes are used in the address.
