### Added

- Network Server ID (NSID) used for Backend Interfaces interoperability via the `ns.interop.id` and `dcs.edcs.ns-id` configuration options.
  - In the Network Server, `ns.interop.id` acts as a fallback value for `sender-ns-id` in Join Server interoperability configuration.
- Key vault cache time-to-live for errors configuration option `key-vault.cache.error-ttl`. This defaults to `key-vault.cache.ttl`.

### Deprecated

- Device Claiming Server configuration option `dcs.edcs.network-server.home-ns-id`. Use `dcs.edcs.ns-id` instead.

### Fixed

- Claiming The Things Indoor Gateways.
- Key unwrap caching.
- Desired RX1 delay and desired beacon frequency not being possible to set for OTAA devices.

### Security

- Fix open redirect vulnerability for Console/Account App logins.
