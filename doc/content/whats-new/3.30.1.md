### Added

- Support fine-grained NbTrans controls while using Dynamic ADR mode in the Console.
- `target_frequency_plan_ids` field in the `ClaimGatewayRequest` message to support setting multiple frequency plans when claiming a gateway.
- User bookmark listing now supports filtering bookmarks by entity type.
  - This can be specified by setting `entity_types` field in `ListUserBookmarksRequest`.

### Deprecated

- The `target_frequency_plan_id` field of the `ClaimGatewayRequest` message and will be removed in the next major release of The Things Stack. Use `target_frequency_plan_ids` instead.

### Fixed

- Fix breadcrumbs order in the Console.
- Show both AFCntDown and NFCntDown in the Device overview in the Console.
- Fixes the keys displayed in the session information section of overview tab of an End Device in the Console - for LW 1.1.x, replaces NwkSKey with FNwkSIntKey. For LX 1.0.x display only the NwkSKey and AppSKey.
