### Added

- Option to store rate limits in Redis. When used, the rate limits are applied over the entire cluster instead of per-instance.
- Field `complement_collaborators` was added to `SearchAccounts`. Allows an user to request the accounts that are not already attached to the entity's collaborator list.
