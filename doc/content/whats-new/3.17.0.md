### Added

- Support reading the Join Server's default JoinEUI and using this in the CLI for end device creation.
  - The Join Server has a new API `GetDefaultJoinEUI`.
  - The default JoinEUI can be configured on the Join Server using the option `--js.default-join-eui`.
- Filtering of end device frequency plans in end device forms based on band id in the Console.
- Showing automatically set entity locations in the Console.
- Applications, OAuth clients, gateways and organizations now have an `administrative_contact` and `technical_contact`.
  - This requires a database schema migration (`ttn-lw-stack is-db migrate`) because of the added columns.

### Deprecated

- The `contact_info` fields of applications, OAuth clients, gateways, organizations and users.

### Fixed

- CLI panic when getting devices.
- Application uplink processing serialization behavior in the Application Server.
