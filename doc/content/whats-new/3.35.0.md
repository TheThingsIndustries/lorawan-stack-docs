### Added

- The NS resends the class C confirmed downlink after the `mac_settings.class_c_timeout` time.
- The CLI now collects telemetry data on which commands and aliases are used. This helps us understand usage patterns and improve the tool.

### Changed

- Increased the default value from 5 to 15 for maximum number of confirmed uplink retransmission for LoRaWAN version prior 1.0.4.
- Ping response settings for the TTIGW protocol to mark less gateway connections as disconnected.
- Improved Network Operations Center's TimescaleDB migrations to avoid possible deadlocks. Migrations now temporarily disable background workers and set a local lock timeout to ensure schema changes can be applied safely and sequentially.
- Increase the payload codec formatter size limit to 64KB.

### Removed

### Fixed

- Network Operations Center has new aggregates for Applications and End-Devices statistics, this seeks to address query timeouts that some tenants have experienced when accessing the Overview page in the metrics dashboard.
  - Previously the calculation was done in hourly aggregates, now they are performed in daily aggregates.
  - This requires a Network Operations Center database migration (`ttn-lw-stack noc-db migrate`).
- Reset used DevNonces button on the Console now works for LoRaWAN 1.0.4 and 1.1 devices.
