The [LoRaWAN device repository](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices) contains device profiles, LoRaWAN information, codecs, and more, for many LoRaWAN devices. Using the device repository to add devices in {{% tts %}} automatically uses the correct LoRaWAN version and regional parameters version, which means less information for you to find!
