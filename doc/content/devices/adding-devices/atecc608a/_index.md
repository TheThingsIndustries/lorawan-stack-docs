The Things Industries and Microchip developed a security solution for LoRaWAN® that enables secure key provisioning and secure cryptographic operations using secure elements.

<!--more-->

{{% tts %}} supports secure key provisioning, secure join and secure communication. It uses Microchip’s hardware secure element (ATECC608B-TNGLORA) and The Things Join Server to securely store the root keys of LoRaWAN devices. As The Things Join Server is network agnostic, end users can use any distribution of {{% tts %}} or any standards compliant LoRaWAN Network Server.
