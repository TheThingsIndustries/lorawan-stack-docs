Instead of adding devices one by one, {{% tts %}} supports multiple methods of adding multiple end devices at once. Adding multiple devices is also referred to as **importing devices**.

<!--more-->

There are two ways to import devices in {{% tts %}} - using [Console]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/interact/console" >}}) or [CLI]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/interact/cli" >}}).

{{% tts %}} supports importing end devices in JSON and CSV format:

- To import devices that are in a JSON file (for example, the one you created by following [Migrating End Devices from {{% ttnv2 %}}]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/migrating/migrating-from-v2" >}}) or [Exporting Devices from ChirpStack]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/migrating/migration-tool/export-from-chirpstack" >}})), use **{{% tts %}} JSON** format (identified by `the-things-stack`). The JSON format data format is documented in the [JSON File Reference]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/adding-devices-in-bulk/device-json" >}}).
- To import devices that are in a CSV file, use the **{{% tts %}} CSV** (identified by `the-things-stack-csv`). The CSV data format is documented in the [CSV File Reference]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/adding-devices-in-bulk/device-csv" >}}), including a handy Excel template.

## Import devices via the Console {#import-devices-via-the-console}

Open your application and click the button **Import end devices**

{{< figure src="import-end-devices.png" alt="import devices" >}}

Select the **File format** and upload the file (e.g. `devices.json` or `devices.csv`).

You can specify **Fallback values** for Frequency plan and LoRaWANÂ® and Regional Parameters version, in case the import file does not specify these settings for the device.

You can also expand the **Advanced claiming and component settings** to set targeted components, and set the claim authentication code to be generated.

Start the import by clicking the **Import end devices** button.

Wait for the end devices to be successfully imported. In case any device fails, you will see a relevant error message in the console.

If the import was successful, your devices are added to the list of end devices in your application.

## Import devices via the CLI

To complete these steps, you need the have the latest version of `ttn-lw-cli` installed on your system.

{{< cli-only >}}

To import a file in {{% tts %}}, run the following command with `ttn-lw-cli`:

```bash
# JSON format
ttn-lw-cli end-devices create --application-id <application-id> < devices.json
# CSV format
ttn-lw-cli end-devices template from-data --local-file devices.csv --format-id the-things-stack-csv \
  | ttn-lw-cli end-devices template execute \
  | ttn-lw-cli end-devices create --application-id <application-id>
```

This will import your devices in {{% tts %}}. In case any device import fails, you will see a relevant error message at the end of the output.

If the import was successful, you will see your devices added to the list of end devices in your application.
