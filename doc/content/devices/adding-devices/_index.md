This section contains instructions for adding LoRaWAN® devices in {{% tts %}}.

<!--more-->

End devices in {{% tts %}} are managed under **Applications**.
An application is a logical collection of devices that can be used to collect devices by function or geographical area. Before proceeding with this guide, [create an application]({{< ref "/integrations/adding-applications/" >}}) first.

This guide assumes that your device is in the [LoRaWAN® Device Repository](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices/) and that you're using the Console. If your device is not in the LoRaWAN® Device Repository or if you want to use {{% tts %}} CLI, see [Manually adding devices ]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/manual/" >}}).

To create a device, first open the application you wish to add the device in. Go to **End devices** in the left menu and click on **+Register end device** to reach the end device registration page.

You will be presented with options to easily onboard your device using its QR code (if you have it), and to register your end device from the [LoRaWAN® Device Repository](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices/) or manually.

## Onboarding devices using QR codes

If your device has a [TR005 LoRaWAN® Device Identification QR Code](https://lora-alliance.org/resource_hub/tr005-lorawan-device-identification-qr-codes/), adding a device is a simple process.
Note not all QR codes on the physical device are scannable. Only TR005 LoRaWAN® Device Identification QR Codes, are supported for this method.

Click the **Scan end device QR code** button and allow {{% tts %}} to use your camera.
Now just bring your device's QR code closer to your camera. A window with data found from the QR code will appear, containing your device's **Claim authentication code**, **JoinEUI**, **DevEUI** and **Brand**.

If the data is correct, click **Apply**.

Now proceed to choose the **Input Method** under the **End device type** section below.

Choose the **Select the end device in the LoRaWAN Device Repository** input method. Then, select the **End device brand**, **Model**, **Hardware Version**, **Software Version**, and **Profile (Region)** for your device.

Choose a **Frequency plan** appropriate for your region. Your device and gateway must use the same [frequency plan]({{< ref "/reference/frequency-plans/" >}}) to communicate.

## Onboarding devices without QR codes

If your device doesn't have a standard [TR005 LoRaWAN® Device Identification QR Code](https://lora-alliance.org/resource_hub/tr005-lorawan-device-identification-qr-codes/), or has a vendor specific QR code, then the device identification and keys have to be entered manually.

First choose the **Select the end device in the LoRaWAN Device Repository** input method. Then, select the **End device brand**, **Model**, **Hardware Version**, **Software Version**, and **Profile (Region)** for your device.

{{< figure src="select-dr-non-qr.png" alt="Creating a new device with the Device Repository" >}}

Choose a **Frequency plan** appropriate for your region. Your device and gateway must use the same [frequency plan]({{< ref "/reference/frequency-plans/" >}}) to communicate. This example uses `Europe 863-870 MHz (SF9 for RX2 - recommended)`.

{{< figure src="fp-non-qr.png" alt="Choosing a frequency plan" >}}

Enter a **JoinEUI/AppEUI** if provided by your manufacturer and click **Confirm**. If it is not provided by the manufacturer and your device is programmable, you can generate a random one in accordance with the test ranges defined by the [IEEE 802 standards](https://ieee802.org/) or use all zeros, just make sure to program the same value into your device.

{{< figure src="non-qr-join-eui.png" alt="Set the Join EUI" >}}

Now enter your **DevEUI**. This should be provided by your manufacturer for commercial devices. If your device is programmable, you may generate an EUI using the **Generate** button, and program it in your device.

For LoRaWAN version 1.0.x devices, you will see an **AppKey** field, and for LoRaWAN version 1.1.x devices you will also see a **NwkKey** field. If these keys are provided by your manufacturer, enter them. Otherwise, use the **Generate** button to create them, and program them into your device.

{{< figure src="non-qr-all-set.png" alt="Set the Device EUI and Device Keys" >}}

{{< /tabs/tab >}}

{{< /tabs/container >}}

Finally, enter an **End device ID**. Advisable is doing it in the format `eui-{Device EUI}`. You can edit this field and give the device a unique identifier. See [ID and EUI constraints]({{< ref "reference/id-eui-constraints" >}}) for guidelines about choosing a unique ID.

Now verify that all the fields are filled and click the **Register end device** button to create the end device.

The device is now registered, and will appear as connected in {{% tts %}} once it sends an uplink.
