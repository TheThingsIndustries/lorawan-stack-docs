You can update the example below with your tenant ID and cluster ID by filling them here.

{{< tenant-cluster-selector >}}

## Prerequisites

1. An application in a The Things Stack Cloud or The Things Stack Enterprise cluster [See instructions]({{< ref "/integrations/adding-applications" >}})
2. A device with a QR code for claiming sticker.

## Claim a Device

Go to the Device Claiming App. The address of the Console includes both your tenant ID and the cluster ID:

<p>
<code data-content="cluster-address">
https://<span data-content="tenant-id"></span>.<span data-content="cluster-id"></span>.cloud.thethings.industries/claim
</code>
</p>

Select the application that you created as a prerequisite.

Authorize your browser to access the camera, scan the the device's QR code for claiming and click on **Save changes**.

The device has been successfully claimed, so you can return to the Console and you will see the device in your application.

Keep in mind that device claiming does not transfer a security session for a device, it only transfers ownership. The original LoRaWAN session is deleted. The device needs to join the network again for traffic to appear.
