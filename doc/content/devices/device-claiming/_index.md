Device claiming is a mechanism that transfers devices securely from one application to another. This section provides guides for making devices claimable and claiming them.

## Who is it for?

It is used to transfer ownership from a device maker to a device owner, or to a new device owner.

### Typical use cases

1. Purchasing a new device and registering it to the Console in an easy and secure way.
2. Transferring ownership to a new device owner.

## How does it work?

After pre-provisioning a device, device makers register it on The Things Industries Join Server or on their Cloud cluster, generate a QR code for claiming and stick it to the device. When purchasing a device, new device owners scan this QR code to claim it to their application.

{{< note >}} Device claiming does not transfer a security session for a device, it only transfers ownership. The original LoRaWAN session is deleted. The device needs to join the network again for traffic to appear. {{</ note >}}
