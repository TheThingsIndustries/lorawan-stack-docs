Device claiming is a mechanism that transfers devices securely from one application to another.

<!--more-->

## Who is it for?

It is used to transfer ownership from a device maker to a device owner, or to a new device owner.

### Typical use cases

1. Purchasing a new device and registering it to the Console in an easy and secure way.
2. Transferring ownership to a new device owner.

## How does it work?

After pre-provisioning a device, device makers register it on The Things Industries Join Server or on their Cloud Hosted cluster, generate a QR code for claiming and stick it to the device. When purchasing a device, new device owners scan this QR code to claim it to their application. [Learn how to claim a device]({{< ref "/devices/device-claiming" >}}).
