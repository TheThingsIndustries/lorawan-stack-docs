# Onboarding to {{% tts %}}

The provisioning information, such as **JoinEUI** and **DevEUI**, can be found on the back of the device.

{{< note "The sensitive information, the **AppKey**, is provided within an Excel sheet via email to the person who purchased it." />}}

The TBMS100 doesn't support onboarding with a QR code. You must proceed directly to the options [**Select the end device in the LoRaWAN Device Repository**]({{< ref "#using-the-lorawan-device-repository" >}}) or [**Enter end device specifics manually**]({{< ref "#manually" >}}).

## Using the LoRaWAN Device Repository

The [LoRaWANÂ® Device repository](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices) comprises over 600 end-device profiles, including the Browan TBMS100, which requires less information for registration with {{% tts %}}.

In the **End device type** section, under **Input method**, select **Select the end device in the LoRaWAN Device Repository** option. The [Onboarding devices without QR codes]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/#onboarding-devices-without-qr-codes" >}}) section of the [Adding Devices]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/" >}}) page explains all the configurations you need to provide. However, the following are the TBMS100 specific configurations you want to include:

- End device brand: **Browan Communication Incorp.**
- Model: **Motion Sensor**
- Hardware Ver.: **1.0**
- Firmware Ver.: **1.0.1**

After providing all the configurations, select the **Register end device** button.

## Manually

The TBMS100 also supports manual registration, but make sure all configurations are provided correctly.

In the **End device type** section, under **Input Method**, select **Enter end device specifics manually** option. The [Manually adding devices]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/manual/" >}}) and [Over the Air Activation (OTAA)]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/manual/otaa/" >}}) pages explain all the configurations you need to provide. However, the following are the TBMS100 specific configurations you want to include:

- LoRaWAN version: **LoRaWAN Specification 1.0.3**
- Regional parameters version: **RP001 Regional Parameters 1.0.3 revision A**

After providing all the configurations, select the **Register end device** button.

Then, select the **Live Data** tab to view all messages exchanged between the end device and the Network Server.
