## Sensor Setup

To acquire the provisioning information and properly setup the sensor you must download the **SenseCap Mate** App from the Play Store or the App Store on your phone.

After opening the app it will ask you to log in/create an account, but you can click on **Skip** in the top right if you don't wish to sign up.

Then click the device you wish to connect to (either the **S210x Sensor** or the **S2100 Data Logger**) and select configuration mode: **Advanced Configuration**. 

The app then explains how to enter Bluetooth pairing mode. Press and hold the button under the device for 3 seconds and release when it starts to blink. Once done click **Device is ready for configuration**. It will then proceed to scan for the device, and it should show up in the list. Click on **your device's serial number** to proceed.

Once you reach the menu of the device, select the **Settings** tab. After that click **Platform** on the dropdown menu. There you need to select **The Things Network**. Make sure the **Frequency Plan** is correct as well. Finally, copy the **Device EUI**, **AppEUI** and **AppKey** and save them as they will be needed later for onboarding.
