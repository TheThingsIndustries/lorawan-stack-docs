## Sensor Setup

To acquire the provisioning information and properly setup the sensor, you must download the **WisToolBox** App from the Play Store or the App Store on your phone.

After opening the app it will ask you to log in/create an account, but you can click on **Skip** in the top right if you don't wish to sign up.

Then press **Start**, select **NFC Activation** and follow the instructions for connecting to the device.

Once you reach the device menu, select the **LORA & LORAWAN PARAMETERS** tab. Open the **Global Settings** dropdown and make sure the **Join mode** and **Region** are set correctly. 

Then open the **LoRaWAN keys, ID, EUI** dropdown and copy the **Device EUI**, **AppEUI** and **AppKey** and save them somewhere as they will be needed later for onboarding.

Finally, select the **Sensor Probe** tab up top and open the dropdowns for the sensors that are used. Here you can set the intervals or thresholds for transmitting data.

Make sure you enable the **Send uplink** toggle depending on which method you use.

## Onboarding to {{% tts %}}

The device can be onboarded using the **Device Repository** or **manually**.

{{< note "The RAK2560 does not support onboarding with a QR code." />}}

The [LoRaWANÂ® Device repository](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices) comprises over 800 end-device profiles, including the RAK2560, which enables quick and easy registration with {{% tts %}}.

In the **End device type** section, under **Input method**, select either the **Select the end device in the LoRaWAN Device Repository** or **Enter end device specifics manually** option. The [Onboarding devices without QR codes]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/#onboarding-devices-without-qr-codes" >}}) section of the [Adding Devices]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/" >}}) guide explains this procedure in detail.
