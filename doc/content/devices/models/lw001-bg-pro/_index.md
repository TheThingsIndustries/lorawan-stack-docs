## Turning on the device

To access the provisioning information (the **JoinEUI/AppEUI**, **DevEUI** and **AppKey**) you need to turn on the device first and connect to it. Before continuing make sure to download the **MKLoRa** app on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moko.mklora) or the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mklora/id1562806152).

To turn on the device, **approach the Hall sensor area with a magnet and quickly move it away 3 times.**
When the power indicator lights up **solid green for 3 seconds**, the device is turned on. The image below illustrates this process.

{{< note "It may take a few tries for the device to properly register the magnet and turn on. Keep swiping the magnet until the LED stays on for 3 seconds." />}}

Open the **MKLoRa** app, select device type (in this case, the LW001-BG PRO) and you should then see the device show up. If not, click on the refresh icon in the top right and make sure that Bluetooth on your phone is on.
