The LHT52 does not support onboarding with a QR code. You must proceed directly to the options [**Select the end device in the LoRaWAN Device Repository**](#using-the-lorawan-device-repository) or [**Enter end device specifics manually**](#manually).

## Using the LoRaWAN Device Repository

The [LoRaWANÂ® Device repository](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices) comprises over 600 end-device profiles, including the Dragino LHT52, which enables quick and easy registration with {{% tts %}}.

In the **End device type** section, under **Input method**, select **Select the end device in the LoRaWAN Device Repository** option. The [Onboarding devices without QR codes]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/#onboarding-devices-without-qr-codes" >}}) section of the [Adding Devices]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/" >}}) page explains all the configurations you need to provide. However, the following are the LHT52 specific configurations you want to include:

- End device brand: **Dragino Technology Co., Limited**
- Model: **LHT52**
- Hardware Ver.: **Unknown ver.**
- Firmware Ver.: **1.0**

After providing all the configurations, select the **Register end device** button.

## Manually

The LHT52 also supports manual registration, but make sure all configurations are provided correctly.

In the **End device type** section, under **Input Method**, select **Enter end device specifics manually** option. The [Manually adding devices]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/manual/" >}}) and [Over the Air Activation (OTAA)]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/manual/otaa/" >}}) pages explain all the configurations you need to provide. However, the following are the LHT52 specific configurations you want to include:

- LoRaWAN version: **LoRaWAN Specification 1.0.3**
- Regional parameters version: **RP001 Regional Parameters 1.0.3 revision A**

After providing all the configurations, select the **Register end device** button.
