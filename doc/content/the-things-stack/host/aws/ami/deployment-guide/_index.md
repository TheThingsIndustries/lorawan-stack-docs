### AWS Deployment Architecture

The following image describes the architecture of the components that are deployed while using the **default parameters**.

{{< figure src="ami-deployment-architecture.svg" alt="AMI deployment Architecture" class="plain" >}}

{{< note >}} The public subnet is not fixed in to an Availability Zone (AZ) and hence is part of the default AZ of the VPC. {{</ note >}}

## Preparation

This section lists the preparatory steps necessary to successfully complete this guide.

### Specialized Knowledge

In order to follow this guide to deploy {{% tts %}}, it is recommended to be familiar with the following concepts:
- AWS EC2, AWS CloudFormation
- Shell and command line usage
- Basics of LoRaWAN® devices and gateways

### Prerequisites

The following are necessary to complete this guide:
1. An account with AWS with access to the AWS Marketplace. If you don't have one, create it by using the [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start) page.
2. An RSA Public-Private Key pair
3. Sufficient rights on your account to create IAM roles
4. A LoRaWAN® compliant Gateway
5. A LoRaWAN compliant End Device
6. Access to a name server for DNS mapping

## Deployment using AWS Cloud Formation

### Step 1: Prepare the Deployment

1. Login to your AWS Marketplace and navigate to the [product page for {{% tts %}} for LoRaWAN](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B081HZKDJ4).
2. Choose the correct AWS Region in which to deploy your stack. Also choose the **Software Pricing Tier** that suits your needs.
3. Make sure to read the terms of usage and other information available.
4. If applicable, [request a service limit increase](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/cases#/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-) for additional VPCs and/or Elastic IPs.
5. Click **Continue to Subscribe** and accept the terms and conditions once they are found satisfactory.
6. Now click **Continue to Configuration** to configure your deployment.

### Step 2: Configure the Deployment

The **Continue to Configuration** button will redirect you to the AWS CloudFormation page where the CloudFormation template is pre-loaded.

### Step 3: Start the Deployment

1. Once the parameters of {{% tts %}} are configured, click **Next** to configure options for the CloudFormation Stack. You may use the defaults in this page. 
2. Click **Next** review the deployment. Select the **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources.** checkbox and click **Create Stack** option. 
3. If all the parameters were entered correctly, AWS CloudFormation triggers the creation of your CloudFormation stack. The stack is now in the `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` state. On average, this process takes about 40 minutes.
4. You can monitor the status of your deployment by navigating to **CloudFormation** > **\<your-stack-name\>** > **Events**.
5. Once the required resources are successfully deployed, the state of the CloudFormation stack is updated to `CREATE_COMPLETE`.

Upon completion of these steps, please head over to the [Post Deployment Configuration guide]({{< relref "../post-deployment" >}})  to configure your deployment.
