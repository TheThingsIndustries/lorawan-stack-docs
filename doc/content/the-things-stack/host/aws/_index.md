1. AWS Marketplace AMI
  - An AWS CloudFormation stack that can be purchased at the AWS Marketplace.
2. AWS ECS

In addition, {{% tts %}} natively supports interaction with AWS IoT. Check the [AWS IoT]({{< ref "/integrations/cloud-integrations/aws-iot" >}}) guide to learn to integrate {{% tts %}} with the AWS IoT services.
