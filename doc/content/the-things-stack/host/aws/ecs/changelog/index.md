# Upgrading

All meaningful changes to templates are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

## 3.31.1

### Proxy

- Add `TenantAccess` grpc service and routes.

## 3.31.0

- Updated ECS AMIs to the latest versions.

## 3.30.2

- TimescaleDB replicas are now split to a separate template. Previously replicas had an ephemeral disk that needed to be copied when the replica was re-deployed. This made some upgrades really long to complete. Now the replicas are standalone and have their own disk that can be reattached to a new instance. This change should make upgrades faster and more reliable.

### Upgrade procedure

- Disable TimescaleDB replicas in the `5-4-ecs-services` template.
- Upgrade the `2-5-db-timescale` template. This will remove TimescaleDB replicas if there were any.
- Deploy the `2-6-db-timescale-replica` template for each replica that was removed in the previous step.
- Re-enable TimescaleDB replicas in the `5-4-ecs-services` template.

### 2-5-db-timescale

- Rename to `2-5-db-timescale-master`.
- Remove replica configuration from the template.

### 2-6-db-timescale-replica

- Add new optional template for TimescaleDB replica.

### `4-2a-configuration`

- Add configuration parameters for the UDP rate limiting firewall (`UDPRateLimitingFirewallEnabled`/`UDPRateLimitingFirewallMessages`/`UDPRateLimitingFirewallThreshold`). Environments which use the general purpose rate limiting of the Gateway Server (via `4-2b-configuration-rate-limiting`) do not need to enable this firewall.

## 3.30.1

### Proxy

- Add email validation paths.

## 3.30.0

### `2-4c-mtls-s3`

- Remove unused bucket policies and update resource tags.

- Remove `GSGatewayTokensHashKey`.

### `4-2a-configuration`

- Remove `GSGatewayTokensHashKey` configuration.

### `5-1-ecs-cluster`

## 3.26.0

### ECS templates

- The UDP Gateway Server service has been removed. Historically this service has been used in order to work around various limitations that AWS Network Load Balancer had with UDP traffic. The service is problematic as it runs as a daemon service on each available ECS host machine, and does not support rolling updates. As the support for UDP traffic has improved in the AWS Network Load Balancer, we have decided to remove this service and have UDP traffic be served by the replica Gateway Server service.

### Upgrade procedure

- As this version upgrade removes certain resources, the standard upgrade procedure which follows the template numbering order cannot be followed directly.
- The configuration of the `5-4-ecs-services` template needs to be updated such that the `EnableUDPGSRateLimiting` and `IncludeUDPGatewayServer` parameters are set to `false`. The template does not have to be updated yet, only the configuration. This will remove the UDP Gateway Server service instances.
- The standard upgrade procedure can commence after the template has been upgraded.
- While upgrading the `5-4-ecs-services` template, consider increasing the number of tasks, or allocated resources, for the Gateway Server service.

- Add NOC rate limiting configuration.

### `5-4-ecs-services`

- The UDP Gateway Server service has been removed. The UDP traffic will now be served by the existing Gateway Server service.
- The default NOC Grafana image has been updated to `ghcr.io/thethingsindustries/lorawan-stack-noc-grafana:3.26.0`.
- Add NOC rate limiting.

### `5-5-ecs-monitoring`

## 3.15.1

## 3.15.0

### `2-5-db-timescale`

- Created a hosted zone for internal use.
- This template has been reworked so that updates are now possible. Before updating make a backup of the volume. For more information, please refer to the documentation at https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/getting-started/aws/ecs/updating/#2-5-db-timescale.
- Added `EBSKmsKeyId` parameter to choose EBS volume encryption key. From now on, EBS volumes are encrypted. Previously only data volume would be encrypted using the default key. Encrypting boot drive does not significantly increase security, and is mainly targeted towards compliance with regulations. If you wish to encrypt your boot drive, please:
  1. Change the `ApplicationServerStorageEnabled` parameter in `5-2-ocs-ops` and `5-4-ecs-services` to `false`.
  2. Create a snapshot of the TimescaleDB EBS volume.
  3. Download your existing `2-5-db-timescale` stack template, remove the `Instance`, `StorageVolume`, `StorageVolumeLifecyclePolicy` and `VolumeLifecycleRole` resources along with the `Outputs` section. Update the stack, the change set should remove these resources.
  4. Update the `2-5-db-timescale` stack with new template to create the EC2 instance and volume again. Do not forget to specify EBS volume snapshot.
  5. Change the `ApplicationServerStorageEnabled` parameter in `5-2-ocs-ops` and `5-4-ecs-services` back to `true`.
  6. For more complex use cases, like changing encryption key, refer to AWS documentation.

### `4-2-configuration`

- Added `ISSupportLink` parameter
- Added `UplinkTasksNumConsumers` and `DownlinkTasksNumConsumers` parameters to the Network Server tasks, which allow the number of task consumers to be configured.

Certain templates have different default values for machine types/memory/CPU in order to better reflect a typical deployment. These changes have no impact on functionalities, and do not affect existing users.

### `2-1-db-aurora-master`

- Allowed encryption of the Aurora database. In order to encrypt existing database:
  1. Remove the `5-3a-ecs-is-service`, `5-2-ecs-ops` and `2-2-db-aurora-replica` (NOT `master`) stacks.
  2. Create a snapshot of the database for backup purposes.
  3. Log into the bastion, and perform an SQL dump of the database. Refer to the `/usr/bin/db-ro` command, which is a bash script, for help how to connect to the database.
  4. Update the `2-1-db-aurora-master` template to include encryption. Do NOT specify the snapshot, as then the encryption parameter will be ignored.
  5. Log into the bastion, and restore the SQL dump.
  6. Recreate the `2-2-db-aurora-replica`, `5-2-ecs-ops` and `5-3a-ecs-is-service` stacks as needed.

- Add `DevEUIBlockEnabled` and `DevEUIBlockApplicationLimit` to Console configuration.
- Add `ApplicationPackagesWorkerCount` and `ApplicationPackagesWorkerCount` to the Application Server configuration.

### `5-4-ecs-services`

- Make execution and task policies conditional. This is compatible with existing deployments.

### `5-5-monitoring`
