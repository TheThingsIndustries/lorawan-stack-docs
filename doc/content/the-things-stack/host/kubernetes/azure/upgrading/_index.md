## Kubernetes version upgrade

AKS Kubernetes version upgrades have to be performed sequentially for each minor version. For example to upgrade from `1.25` to `1.27` it's necessary to upgrade to version `1.26` first as an intermediate step. For more information refer to the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions).
