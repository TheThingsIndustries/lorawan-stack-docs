This is a guide for installing {{% tts %}} Enterprise or Open Source on your own hardware using Docker, to run your own private LoRaWANÂ® network server.

<!--more-->

There are several ways to run {{% tts %}}.

{{% tts %}} Open Source and Enterprise distributions are designed to run on your own hardware, which this guide covers.

Alternatively, to use {{% tts %}} in the cloud without installing it on your own hardware, see [{{% tts %}} Cloud]({{< relref "cloud" >}}) (our professional, SLA-backed offering) or [{{% ttss %}}]({{< relref "ttn" >}}) (our free-to-use {{% ttss %}}). To spin up your own EC2 instance, there is also an [AWS Launcher]({{< relref "aws" >}}). To install using balenaCloud on a Rasperry Pi, see the [Balena]({{< relref "balena" >}}) section.

For highly available production cloud deployments with high throughput, we recommend using {{% tts %}} Cloud or AWS Launcher. All deployments of {{% tts %}} except Open Source and AWS Launcher support multi-tenancy, which allows you to create multiple private network servers within a single deployment, for example to resell to individual clients.

Continue following these instructions to run {{% tts %}} Enterprise or Open Source on your own hardware, using Docker.

In addition to the following written instructions, video instructions for installing {{% tts %}} are available on [The Things Network youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcmgJMvMfZc).

## Prerequisites

1. A server with a recommended 4 virtual CPUs and 16GB RAM running [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)\*
2. DNS records pointing to your server's IP address (skip if using `localhost`)
3. A [license](https://thethingsindustries.com/technology/pricing) for {{% tts %}} (only for Enterprise)

\*Benchmark for 100K devices with 12 confirmed uplinks per day. Your requirements will vary depending on your load and desired redundancy.

If purchasing an Enterprise license, consider setting up a multi-tenant environment from the beginning if you plan to add tenants later. Switching from a a single-tenant to multi-tenant environment requires database migration.

For multi-tenant deployments, DNS records for `*.domain` need to be created in addition to the plain `domain` record. For offline deployments, internal DNS pointing to your server's IP address can be used, and The Things Industries can provide a license for that domain name.

This guide shows you how to get everything up and running on a server. If you are comfortable with configuring servers and working with command line, this is the perfect place to start, but first, follow the guides to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms), to [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose), and to [configure permissions for Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

Next, see instructions on how to [configure]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/host/docker/configuration" >}}), set up [certificates]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/host/docker/certificates" >}}) and finally [run {{% tts %}}]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/host/docker/running-the-stack" >}})!
