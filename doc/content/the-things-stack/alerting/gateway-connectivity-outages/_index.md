## How a gateway connectivity outage alert is triggered

{{% tts %}} generates alerts when a gateway has been disconnected for too long. By default, a gateway connectivity outage alert is generated if a gateway is disconnected for longer than 10 minutes.

## How often a gateway outage notification is sent

Gateway connectivity outage alerts generate notifications upon opening and closure, and every 6 hours in between these two events.

## How long is a gateway connectivity outage alert open

Gateway connectivity outage alerts will not stay open in perpetuity. By default, the alerts will be closed automatically after being open for 24 hours.
