This section documents the process of migrating end devices from {{% ttnv2 %}} to {{% tts %}}.

<!--more-->

Keep in mind that {{% ttnv2 %}} machines were shut down on December 1, 2021, so devices can no longer be migrated from there. It is only possible to register them from scratch on {{% tts %}}. However, it is still possible to migrate devices from private {{% ttnv2 %}} servers, which is described in this section.

## Prerequisites

1. User account on deprecated The Things Network {{% ttnv2 %}} or The Things Industries {{% ttnv2 %}}.
2. User account in {{% tts %}}.

We recommend testing migration on a single end device or a small batch of end devices in order to make sure the migration process goes as expected.

We **highly recommend** using {{% tts %}} version `3.12.0` or higher. Some of the features (like session migration) from this guide might not be available for prior versions.

## Add Application in {{% tts %}}

Since end devices are being created within applications, you first need to add a new application in {{% tts %}}. See [Adding Applications]({{< ref "/integrations/adding-applications" >}}) for detailed instructions.

When adding an application in {{% tts %}}, the **Application ID** does not have to be the same as the one in {{% ttnv2 %}}.

## Add Payload Formatters and Integrations in {{% tts %}}

After creating an application, you need to add the associated elements like application-level payload formatters and integrations.

The payload formatters can be uplink and downlink, and they are what was known in {{% ttnv2 %}} as encoders and decoders. In {{% tts %}}, it is also possible to add payload formatters per end device, which override application payload formatters. However, before devices are migrated to {{% tts %}} it is only possible to add a payload formatter per application.

The format of {{% ttnv2 %}} payload encoders and decoders is still supported in {{% tts %}}. You only need to add one additional line to the function code used in {{% ttnv2 %}} to make it fully compatible with {{% tts %}}. For example, if your payload decoder function in {{% ttnv2 %}} was:

```js
function Decoder(bytes) {
    var temperature = bytes[0] | bytes[2];
    return {
        temperature: temperature;
    }
}
```

then your uplink payload formatter function in {{% tts %}} should be:

```js
function decodeUplink(input) {
    var bytes = input.bytes;
    var temperature = bytes[0] | bytes[2];
    return {
        temperature: temperature;
    }
}
```

See [Payload Formatters]({{< ref "/integrations/payload-formatters" >}}) guide for detailed instructions on how to add payload formatters and which types are supported by {{% tts %}}.

For detailed tutorials on the integrations that are available in {{% tts %}}, see [Integrations]({{< ref "/integrations/payload-formatters" >}}).

## Migrate End Devices

When you have added your application and elements associated with it, it is time to migrate your end device(s) from {{% ttnv2 %}} to {{% tts %}}.

Since the {{% ttnv2 %}} machines were shut down, `ttn-lw-migrate` is no longer able to migrate devices from those servers. You can only add those entities in {{% tts %}}.

However, devices can still be migrated from private {{% ttnv2 %}} servers to {{% tts %}}. There are two approaches for migrating devices, depending on how many end devices you intend to migrate and if you wish to migrate with or without active sessions, described in the following guides:

- [Migrate using the Console]({{< relref "migrate-using-console" >}})
- [Migrate using the Migration Tool]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/migrating/migrating-from-v2/migrate-using-migration-tool/" >}})
