This guide documents the process of migrating end devices and gateways to {{% tts %}} and between different installations of {{% tts %}}.

<!--more-->

End devices can be migrated from one {{% tts %}} deployment to another (e.g. [from {{% ttss %}} to {{% tts %}} Cloud]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/migrating/migrating-between-tts-distributions" >}})) or from any other LoRaWANÂ® network (like [Chirpstack]({{< relref "export-from-chirpstack" >}})).

Depending on how many devices you are migrating and which network you are migrating from, there are multiple migration methods you can apply. Find your specific use case in subsections below and learn how to migrate your devices to a desired {{% tts %}} deployment.
