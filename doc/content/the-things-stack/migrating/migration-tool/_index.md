[`ttn-lw-migrate`](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack-migrate) is a tool that can be used for migrating end devices and applications from supported LoRaWAN networks (like [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/)) to {{% tts %}}, or between {{% tts %}} distributions. This section provides details on how to install, configure and use this tool.

<!--more-->

This tool works in a way that it exports descriptions of end devices and applications to a [JSON file]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/migrating/device-json" >}}), that can later be [imported in {{% tts %}}]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/migrating/import-devices" >}}).

## Installation

The migration tool can be installed using package managers or manually from binary files. We highly recommend installing or upgrading to `ttn-lw-migrate` version `0.5.0` or newer, because some features like session migration are not available for prior versions.
