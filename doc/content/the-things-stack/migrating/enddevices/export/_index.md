[`ttn-lw-migrate`](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack-migrate) is a tool that can be used for exporting end devices and applications from supported LoRaWANÂ® networks to {{% tts %}} format, or between {{% tts %}} distributions.

<!--more-->

This section provides details on how to install, configure and use this tool.

This tool works in a way that it exports descriptions of end devices and applications to a [JSON file]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/adding-devices-in-bulk/device-json" >}}), that can later be [imported in {{% tts %}}]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/adding-devices-in-bulk" >}}).

## Installation

The migration tool can be installed using package managers or manually from binary files. We recommend to always keep the migration tooling up to date.
