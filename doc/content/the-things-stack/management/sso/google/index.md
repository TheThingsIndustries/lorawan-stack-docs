This section contains instructions to configure Google OpenID Connect to work with {{% tts %}}.

<!-- more -->

Configuring OpenID Connect with your Google account will allow single sign-on from any account within your Google organization. This requires administrator rights to that organization.

## Create an OAuth Client ID

From the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), navigate to **APIs and Services**, and choose **Credentials** in the left hand menu.

Click **Create Credentials** and choose **OAuth client ID**.

Choose **Web application** for the **Application type**.

Give the Application a **Name** of your choosing, and enter the **Redirect URI** of your {{% tts %}} deployment. The URI is the [Server Address]({{< ref "the-things-stack/concepts/server-addresses" >}}) followed by the OAuth endpoint, which includes an **Authentication Provider ID** of your choosing:

`
/oauth/login/<authentication-provider-id>/callback
`

You will actually create the Authentication Provider in {{% tts %}} using this Authentication Provider ID, so remember it.

For example, with a tenant `tenant1` in the `eu1` cluster and an Authentication Provider ID of `goog`, the OAuth Callback URL is:

`
https://tenant1.eu1.cloud.thethings.industries/oauth/login/goog/callback
`

{{< figure src="callback.png" >}}

Click **Create** and you will be presented with the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for this provider.

Proceed to [Configure {{% tts %}} for SSO]({{< relref "../../sso#configure-the-things-stack-for-sso" >}}) using the following information:

- **Client ID**: Provided by Google
- **Client Secret**: Provided by Google
- **Authentication Provider ID**: Of your choosing (see above)
- **Callback URL**: Includes your Authentication Provider ID (see above)
- **OpenID Discovery Address**: `https://accounts.google.com`
