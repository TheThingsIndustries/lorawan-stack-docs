This guide explains how to manage and customize your cloud account.

## Tenants on Shared Infrastructure

{{% tts %}} Cloud is a multi-tenant environment. This means that while each customer has their own isolated network, the underlying infrastructure is shared with other customers.

After starting your {{% tts %}} Cloud subscription, you will receive an email with the details of your tenant and details of your admin user.

## Clusters

{{% tts %}} Cloud is a multi-cluster deployment. This means that while your account information is stored in a central location, you can connect your gateways to a closer cluster, and route all your IoT traffic in that cluster. This can significantly reduce latency because your traffic would not have to cross half the planet.

{{% tts %}} Cloud currently has the following clusters:

| **Cluster ID** | **Name**        | **Location**      |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| `au1`          | Australia 1     | Sydney, Australia |
| `as1`          | Asia 1          | Tokyo, Japan      |
| `eu1`          | Europe 1        | Dublin, Ireland   |
| `eu2`          | Europe 2        | London, UK        |
| `nam1`         | North America 1 | California, USA   |

If you navigate to [this link](https://console.cloud.thethings.industries), you can find out which {{% tts %}} Cloud clusters are recommended for your deployment based on the location of your devices and immediately log into its Console.
