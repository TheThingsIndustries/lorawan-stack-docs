The streaming data integrations provide multiple formats for the delivery of application uplink messages and downlink queue operations. This section will delve into the common formats used by them.

Read about LoRaWANÂ® message types in [The Things Network documentation](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/message-types/).

## JSON

The JSON message format is described in the sections below.

{{< note >}} Empty fields are omitted from payloads. As such, if a certain field has a value of `""`, `0` or `false` it will not be present in the message. {{</ note >}}

### Join-accept Messages

The JSON join-accept messages use the following format:

```javascript
{
  "end_device_ids" : {
    "device_id" : "dev1",                    // Device ID
    "application_ids" : {
      "application_id" : "app1"              // Application ID
    },
    "dev_eui" : "0004A30B001C0530",          // DevEUI of the end device
    "join_eui" : "800000000000000C",         // JoinEUI of the end device (also known as AppEUI in LoRaWAN versions below 1.1)
    "dev_addr" : "00BCB929"                  // Device address known by the Network Server
  },
  "correlation_ids" : [ "as:up:01..." ],     // Correlation identifiers of the message
  "received_at" : "2020-02-12T15:15..."      // ISO 8601 UTC timestamp at which the message has been received by the Application Server
  "join_accept" : {
    "session_key_id" : "AXBSH1Pk6Z0G166...", // Join Server issued identifier for the session keys
    "received_at" : "2020-02-17T07:49..."    // ISO 8601 UTC timestamp at which the uplink has been received by the Network Server
  }
}
```

### Uplink Messages

The JSON uplink messages use the following format:

```javascript
{
  "end_device_ids" : {
    "device_id" : "dev1",                    // Device ID

{{< note >}} End device key-value attributes are not included in uplink messages, because these attributes are stored in the Identity Server and normally they are static, so sending that data with every uplink is inefficient. Users can instead fetch device's attributes using the API:

```bash
curl --request GET /
  --location 'https://thethings.example.com/api/v3/applications/<application-id>/devices/<device-id>?field_mask=attributes' /
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <api-key>"
```

### Downlink Events Messages

The JSON downlink `ack`, `nack`, `queued` and `sent` events messages use the following format:

```javascript
{
  "end_device_ids" : {
    "device_id" : "dev1",                    // Device ID

### Downlink Messages

The JSON downlink messages use the following format:

```javascript
{
  "end_device_ids" : {
    "device_id" : "dev1",                    // Device ID
    "application_ids" : {
      "application_id" : "app1"              // Application ID
    }
  },
  "downlinks": [{
    "f_port": 15,                            // Frame port
    "frm_payload": "vu8=",                   // Frame payload (Base64)
    "decoded_payload" : {                    // Decoded payload object, to be encoded by the device payload formatter
      "temperature": 1.0,
      "luminosity": 0.64
    },
    "priority": "NORMAL",                    // Priority of the message in the downlink queue
    "confirmed": true,                       // If the downlink expects a confirmation from the device or not
    "correlation_ids" : [ "custom-id" ]      // Correlation identifiers of the message
  }]
}
```

The end device identifiers need to be supplied only to frontends that do not derive it from other sources (such as the URL for webhooks or topic name for MQTT).
