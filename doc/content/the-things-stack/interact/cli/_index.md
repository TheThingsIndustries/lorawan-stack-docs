Although the web interface of {{% tts %}} (the Console) currently has support for all basic features of {{% tts %}}, for more advanced actions, you may need to use the Command-Line Interface (CLI).

This section contains instructions for installing, configuring, and logging in with the CLI, so you can use it with your {{% tts %}} deployment.

<!--more-->

To use the CLI, you need to complete three steps:

1. [Install the CLI]({{< relref "installing-cli" >}})
2. [Configure the CLI]({{< relref "configuring-cli" >}})
3. [Login with the CLI]({{< relref "login" >}})

If you need help with any CLI command, use the `--help` flag to get a list of subcommands, flags and their description and aliases.

For a complete list of CLI commands, see the [CLI reference]({{< ref "reference/cli" >}}).

For troubleshooting common CLI errors, see the [Troubleshooting CLI]({{< relref "troubleshooting" >}}) section.
