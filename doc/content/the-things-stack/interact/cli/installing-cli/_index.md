This section contains instructions for installing the command-line interface.

<!--more-->

There are two versions of {{% tts %}} CLI: `ttn-lw-cli`and `tti-lw-cli`. For most users, `ttn-lw-cli` is sufficient, as it supports all commands to manage {{% tts %}}. `tti-lw-cli` has additional commands for tenant management and OpenID Connect but is otherwise identical.

We recommend Cloud, {{% ttss %}}, and Open Source users to install `ttn-lw-cli`, and Enterprise users to install `tti-lw-cli`.

## Installing using a package manager (recommended)

{{% tts %}} CLI can be installed using a package manager on macOS and Linux, and we recommend this over manual installation of binaries. Installation using a package manager enables [auto-completion](#auto-completion-optional) and makes it easy to upgrade or remove the CLI. Unfortunately, there is no package manager support in Windows, so Windows users must [use binaries](#windows).

Read this section to find out how to install {{% tts %}} CLI on your operating system with commonly used package managers.

### macOS

On macOS, Homebrew is the recommended package manager. See the [official Homebrew documentation](https://brew.sh/) for installation instructions.

{{< tabs/container "Cloud, Sandbox, and Open Source" "Enterprise" >}}

{{< tabs/tab "Cloud, Sandbox, and Open Source" >}}

Once Homebrew is installed on your system, you can install {{% tts %}} CLI using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
brew install TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack/ttn-lw-cli
```

To upgrade the CLI if it is already installed, use:

```bash
brew upgrade TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack/ttn-lw-cli
```

Once installation is complete, you can run the CLI using `ttn-lw-cli` in your terminal.

{{< /tabs/tab >}}

{{< tabs/tab "Enterprise" >}}

Once Homebrew is installed on your system, you can install {{% tts %}} CLI using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
brew install TheThingsIndustries/lorawan-stack/tti-lw-cli
```

To upgrade the CLI if it is already installed, use:

```bash
brew upgrade TheThingsIndustries/lorawan-stack/tti-lw-cli
```

Now you can run the CLI using `tti-lw-cli` in your terminal.

{{< /tabs/tab >}}

{{< /tabs/container >}}

### Linux

On Linux, `snap` is the recommended package manager. See the [official `snap` documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs) for installation instructions.

{{< tabs/container "Cloud, Sandbox, and Open Source" "Enterprise" >}}

{{< tabs/tab "Cloud, Sandbox, and Open Source" >}}

Once `snap` is installed on your system, you can install {{% tts %}} CLI using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo snap install ttn-lw-stack
sudo snap alias ttn-lw-stack.ttn-lw-cli ttn-lw-cli
```

To upgrade the CLI if it is already installed, use:

```bash
sudo snap refresh ttn-lw-stack
```

Once installation is complete, you can run the CLI using `ttn-lw-cli` in your terminal.

{{< /tabs/tab >}}

{{< tabs/tab "Enterprise" >}}

Once `snap` is installed on your system, you can install {{% tts %}} CLI using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo snap install tti-lw-stack
sudo snap alias tti-lw-stack.tti-lw-cli tti-lw-cli
```

To upgrade the CLI if it is already installed, use:

```bash
sudo snap refresh tti-lw-stack
```

Now you can run the CLI using `tti-lw-cli` in your terminal.

### Windows

No package manager is available for Windows. Follow instructions in the [Installing using pre-built binaries]({{< ref "/the-things-stack/interact/cli/installing-cli#installing-using-pre-built-binaries" >}}) section below to download the [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack/releases) for Windows based on the processor architecture.

Note that Windows binaries must be run with a `.exe` extension on the end, so if an example uses `ttn-lw-cli`, that will be `ttn-lw-cli.exe` on Windows.

## Installing using pre-built binaries

If your operating system does not support a package manager or you do not want to use one, you can still download pre-built binaries for your operating system and processor architecture.

The commands to determine your processor architecture depend on your operating system. On Linux and macOS you can use `uname -m` in your terminal, while on Windows you can use `echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%`.

Use the following form to select the correct binaries for your architecture.

{{< cli-downloader >}}

### See binaries for all releases

To see old versions of the CLI, or if the binary selector above does not work, find all releases of `ttn-lw-cli` [here](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack/releases).

Scroll down and expand the **Assets** section to see the binaries. Search for archives starting with `lorawan-stack-cli` (usually on top), then search for the specific archive ending with your operating system and processor architecture label.

{{< figure src="binaries.png" >}}

For example, if you are using a Linux operating system on a computer with an AMD64 processor, you need to download `lorawan-stack-cli_x.x.x_linux_amd64.tar.gz`.

Open the downloaded archive and extract it to the desired location. Enter the extracted directory.

You can now run the CLI from inside that directory, or add that directory to `PATH` to run the CLI from any location.

## Auto-completion (optional)

After you have installed the CLI, you can also enable [auto-completion](ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion). Auto-completion allows the shell to automatically fill in commands after you type the first few letters. It is completely optional but can save you time entering commands.

Supported shells are `bash`, `zsh`, `fish` and `powershell`.

{{< note >}} When installing {{% tts %}} CLI with `brew` and `snap` package managers, auto-completion is enabled automatically. {{</ note >}}

### macOS and Linux

Use `ttn-lw-cli complete` to generate an auto-completion script for the `ttn-lw-cli` command while specifying the shell you are using:

```bash
ttn-lw-cli complete --shell bash --executable ttn-lw-cli > ttn-lw-cli-autocomplete
```

Now you need to source the generated file to enable auto-completion:

```bash
. ./ttn-lw-cli-autocomplete
```

Alternatively, put in a default directory so that it gets loaded automatically (this directory depends on your operating system and your shell).

For example, for `bash`, this directory is typically `/etc/bash_completion.d/`:

```bash
sudo cp ./ttn-lw-cli-autocomplete /etc/bash_completion.d/
```

### Windows

Generating and sourcing an auto-completion PowerShell script on Windows is slightly different. In addition to `ttn-lw-cli` being replaced with `ttn-lw-cli.exe`, `ttn-lw-cli-autocomplete` needs to be replaced with `ttn-lw-cli-autocomplete.ps1` as follows:

```bash
ttn-lw-cli.exe complete --shell powershell --executable ttn-lw-cli.exe > ttn-lw-cli-autocomplete.ps1

. ./ttn-lw-cli-autocomplete.ps1
```

## Configuring the CLI

Once you have installed the CLI, you need to configure it to connect to your {{% tts %}} deployment. Proceed to [Configuring the CLI]({{< relref "../configuring-cli" >}}).
