Although the web interface of {{% tts %}} (the Console) currently has support for all basic features of {{% tts %}}, for some actions, you need to use the Command-Line Interface (CLI). The CLI allows you to manage all features of {{% tts %}}.

You can use the CLI on your local machine and on the server.

For a complete list of CLI commands, see the [CLI reference]({{< ref "reference/cli" >}}).

For troubleshooting common CLI errors, see the [Troubleshooting CLI]({{< relref "troubleshooting" >}}) section.

{{< note >}} If you need help with any CLI command, use the `--help` flag to get a list of subcommands, flags and their description and aliases. {{</ note >}}
