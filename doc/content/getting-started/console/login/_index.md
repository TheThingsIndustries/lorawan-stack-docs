## Step by step

The Console needs to be logged on in order to create gateways, applications, devices and API keys. With {{% tts %}} running, open `https://thethings.example.com` (replace with the URL of your deployment) in your browser. See [Server Addresses]({{< ref "getting-started/server-addresses" >}}).

When you use a new account, you may not be able to continue until you have confirmed your email address or your account is approved by an admin user.

After entering your credentials and logging in, you will reach the Console overview page.
