You will be redirected to a dedicated profile settings page.

## General Settings

To change basic info such as your profile picture, name or email address, click the **Expand** button next to the **General settings** section.

For profile picture, the [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) image associated with your email address is used by default. You can choose to **Upload an image** to change your profile picture.

You cannot change the **User ID**, but you can set your name to be displayed instead by filling in the **Name** field.

You can change the primary email address associated with your {{% tts %}} account by entering a new one in the **Email address** field.

Click **Save changes** to save any modified info.

## Change password

To set up a new password for your account, click the **Expand** button next to the **Change password** section.

Type in your **Current password**, then create a **New password** and confirm it. We highly recommend you create a strong password to enhance your profile's security.

You can also choose to revoke all currently active sessions and access tokens by ticking the **Enabled** checkbox under **Revoke all access**. This will require you to log into the Console again using your newly created password.
