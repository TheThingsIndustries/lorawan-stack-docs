{{% tts %}} is a LoRaWAN Network Server stack which is the critical component for any LoRaWAN solution. This guide quickly gets the read up to speed with the basics of {{% tts %}}.

<!--more-->

{{% tts %}} is an enterprise grade LoRaWAN server (that includes both the Network Server and Application Server functions mentioned in the LoRaWAN Reference architecture). In addition, {{% tts %}} contains services and tools to securely manage millions of LoRaWAN devices in production.

{{% tts %}} offers the following options for LoRaWAN deployments in production.

- The quickest way to get started with LoRaWAN is to sign up to [{{% tts %}} Cloud]({{< relref "cloud" >}}) a fully-managed SLA-backed cloud subscription. By using {{% tts %}} Cloud, you can focus on scaling your LoRaWAN deployments while leaving the complexity of managing a production LoRaWAN Network Server to us. The Things Stack Cloud offers a [free discovery tier](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/stack/plans/) to get started and is the recommended option for most new users.

- Alternatively, if you prefer to take on the responsibility of installing and maintaining {{% tts %}} in addition to managing your LoRaWAN device fleet, {{% tts %}} is available to be [installed on your own hardware or cloud infrastructure]({{< relref "setup" >}}).

For simple community projects and local testing, there are a few options.

- A free and limited version of {{% tts %}} called [{{% tts %}} Community Edition]{{< relref "ttn" >}} is available to [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) community for simple proof-of-concepts and community projects. This service comes with no guarantees and is entirely at the risk of the users.

- For the DIYâ€™ers, the core features of The Things Stack are [open source](https://github.com/thethingsnetwork/lorawan-stack) and is available for local testing.

{{% tts %}} is developed and maintained by [The Things Industries](https://thethingsindustries.com/).
