## Unreleased

## 3.19.1

## 3.19.0

### `4-2a-configuration`
- Added new parameter `ConsoleStatusPageBaseURL`
- Added new parameter `UserRightsUpdatePrimaryEmailAddress`
- Added new parameter `UserRightsUpdateName`
- Added the `RedisConnectionPoolSize` and `RedisConnectionPoolIdleTimeout` parameters to control the Redis connection pool of each component

## 3.17.1

## 3.17.0

### `3-2-load-balancer-rules`
- The `InteropEnabled` parameter has different values. Deployments that used value `false` should now choose `disabled`. Deployments that used value `true` should now choose `mutual-authentication`. `server-only-authentication` is a new option, please refer to documentation: https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/getting-started/aws/ecs/interop/

### `5-3a-ecs-is-service`

## 3.16.3

## 3.16.2

### All

- All templates now have an output `VersionTag`, which contains template version. Normally, CloudFormation rejects updates that don't contain changes to Resources and Outputs, but contain changes to Parameters. Having this allows CloudFormation to accept all updates, even if changes are only in the Parameters section. It is important to keep stacks up to date.

- Added ARM-based RDS and ElastiCache instance types.

### `2-1-db-aurora-master` and `2-2-db-aurora-replica`
- Added missing `db.r5` instances.

### `2-3-db-redis`

## 3.15.1

## 3.15.0

### `1-2-bastion`
- Added `EBSKmsKeyId` parameter to choose EBS boot volume encryption key. From now on, EBS boot volumes are encrypted.

### `2-5-db-timescale`
- Created a hosted zone for internal use
- This template has been reworked so that updates are now possible. Before updating make a backup of the volume. For more information, please refer to the documentation at https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/getting-started/aws/ecs/updating/#2-5-db-timescale
- Added `EBSKmsKeyId` parameter to choose EBS volume encryption key. From now on, EBS volumes are encrypted. Previously only data volume would be encrypted using the default key. Encrypting boot drive does not significantly increase security, and is mainly targeted towards compliance with regulations. If you wish to encrypt your boot drive, please:
  1. Change the `ApplicationServerStorageEnabled` parameter in `5-2-ocs-ops` and `5-4-ecs-services` to `false`.
  2. Create a snapshot of the TimescaleDB EBS volume.
  3. Download your existing `2-5-db-timescale` stack template, remove the `Instance`, `StorageVolume`, `StorageVolumeLifecyclePolicy` and `VolumeLifecycleRole` resources along with the `Outputs` section. Update the stack, the change set should remove these resources.
  4. Update the `2-5-db-timescale` stack with new template to create the EC2 instance and volume again. Do not forget to specify EBS volume snapshot.
  5. Change the `ApplicationServerStorageEnabled` parameter in `5-2-ocs-ops` and `5-4-ecs-services` back to `true`.
  6. For more complex use cases, like changing encryption key, refer to AWS documentation.

### `4-2-configuration`
- Added `ISSupportLink` parameter
- Added `UplinkTasksNumConsumers` and `DownlinkTasksNumConsumers` parameters to the Network Server tasks, which allow the number of task consumers to be configured.
- Added `SkipVersionCheck` parameter to omit version checks
- `NetworkServerClusterID` has been renamed to `ClusterID`, as now it's a parameter accessed by all services. Make sure you enter the old value.

### `4-2c-configuration-resource-limiting`
- Added a new template for resource limiting

### `5-2-ecs-ops`
- This template now imports TimescaleDB address in a different way.

### `5-4-ecs-services`
- This template now imports TimescaleDB address in a different way.

### Prometheus
- Added recording rules for Gateway Server transmission success / failure
- Added recording rules for Application Server worker pools, webhooks and application packages

## 3.14.2

### `2-1-db-aurora-master`

- Allowed any string matching the `((10)|(11))\.\d+` regex as Aurora version so that RDS with up-to-date minor version can be deployed.

### Proxy

- Headers with underscores are now dropped, instead of rejecting the whole request.

### Prometheus

- Upgraded to v2.29.2.

## 3.14.1

### `5-4-ecs-services`
- Added `IncludeSemtechRJSConfiguration` parameter to include/exclude Semtech RJS configuration. This is a bugfix, as previous version failed to deploy when Semtech RJS secrets weren't available.

### Proxy

- Fixed generated `is-proxy` configuration.
- Allow more concurrent requests (mostly event streams) to the Console.

### Prometheus

- Added recording rule for JavaScript payload formatters latency metric.

## 3.14.0

Certain templates have different default values for machine types/memory/CPU in order to better reflect a typical deployment. These changes have no impact on functionalities, and do not affect existing users.

### `2-1-db-aurora-master`
- Allowed encryption of the Aurora database. In order to encrypt existing database:
  1. Remove the `5-3a-ecs-is-service`, `5-2-ecs-ops` and `2-2-db-aurora-replica` (NOT `master`) stacks.
  2. Create a snapshot of the database for backup purposes.
  3. Log into the bastion, and perform an SQL dump of the database. Refer to the `/usr/bin/db-ro` command, which is a bash script, for help how to connect to the database.
  4. Update the `2-1-db-aurora-master` template to include encryption. Do NOT specify the snapshot, as then the encryption parameter will be ignored.
  5. Log into the bastion, and restore the SQL dump.
  6. Recreate the `2-2-db-aurora-replica`, `5-2-ecs-ops` and `5-3a-ecs-is-service` stacks as needed.

### `3-2-load-balancer-rules`
- Added alternative certificates support for all TLS listeners.

### `4-2a-configuration`
- Changed log format to JSON.
- Added `NetworkServerClusterID` which identifies cluster in the Network Server for informative purposes. Suggested value the same as `PacketBrokerClusterID`.
- Updated `ttnv2` config. This change is not backwards compatible. This needs to be deployed before updating GS services to `v3.14` or higher.
- Add `DevEUIBlockEnabled` and `DevEUIBlockApplicationLimit` to Console configuration.
- Add `ApplicationPackagesWorkerCount` and `ApplicationPackagesWorkerCount` to the Application Server configuration.

### `5-4-ecs-services`
- Make execution and task policies conditional. This is compatible with existing deployments.

### `5-5-monitoring`
- Better control on what services Prometheus should expect to find, and what shouldn't. This change is mainly targeted to non-standard deployments. Added `Include*` parameters which tell whether given component should be expected. Please note that by default both `IncludeIdentityServer` and `IncludeIdentityServerProxy` are `true`, while actually it's one of these that is used.

### `5-7a-certs-le`

- Added option to skip automatically fetching wildcard certificates for the sub domain.

### Certbot

- Added option to skip automatically fetching wildcard certificates for the sub domain.

- Add recording rule for v3.13.1 `ttn_lw_log_messages_total` metric. The recording rule for the old `ttn_lw_log_messages_rate` is also still present.

### `3-2-load-balancer-rules`

- Added client IP preservation to the Gateway Server MQTTv2, Gateway Server MQTTv3, Gateway Server BasicStation, GatewayServer TabsHubs and Application Server MQTT target groups. Deployments which set the Application Server MQTT connection rate limits to high values to avoid throttling should consider reverting the rate limit to the default value.

### `4-2b-configuration-rate-limiting`

- Updated the default Gateway Server uplink rate to 100 uplinks per second (6000 per minute).

## 3.13.0

### build

### `5-1-ecs-cluster`
- Added LifecycleHook for service draining when ECS EC2 machines are terminated. Added resources `ECSAutoScalingGroupDraining*`, replacement of `ECSLaunchConfiguration`, update of `ECSAutoScalingGroup` - here it says `Conditional` replacement due to update of `LaunchConfigurationName`, but in reality there is no replacement
