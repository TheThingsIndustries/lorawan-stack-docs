This section contains instructions for managing organizations.

<!--more-->

To make it easier to manage groups of users, it is possible to create organizations with specific rights which apply to all users who are collaborators. To use organizations, users must be added as collaborators of the organization, and the organization must be added as a collaborator of an entity.

{{< note >}} When a user is a collaborator of an organization which is a collaborator for an entity, the user's rights are the intersection of the user's rights in the organization and the organization's rights on the entity. {{</ note >}}

## Managing Organizations using the CLI

## Creating Organizations

Administrators can create organizations as follows:

```bash
$ ttn-lw-cli organizations create org1 --user-id user1
```

This will create an organization `org1` with all the rights of `user1` and make `user1` a collaborator within the organization.

Output:

```json
{
  "ids": {
    "organization_id": "org1"
  },
  "created_at": "2020-07-14T09:37:01.938Z",
  "updated_at": "2020-07-14T09:37:01.938Z"
}
```

## Listing Organizations

To list organizations with the CLI, use the `organizations list` command.

```bash
$ ttn-lw-cli organizations list
```

```json
[{
  "ids": {
    "organization_id": "org1"
  },
  "created_at": "2020-07-09T12:39:35.129Z",
  "updated_at": "2020-07-09T12:39:35.129Z"
}
, {
  "ids": {
    "organization_id": "org2"
  },
  "created_at": "2020-07-14T09:37:01.938Z",
  "updated_at": "2020-07-14T09:37:01.938Z"
}]
```

## Searching for Organizations

To search for organizations with the CLI, use the `organizations search` command. Make sure to specify the fields you're interested in. This example will search for organizations with IDs that contain `org1`:

```bash
$ ttn-lw-cli organizations search --id-contains org1
```

Output:

```json
[{
  "ids": {
    "organization_id": "org1"
  },
  "created_at": "2020-07-09T12:39:35.129Z",
  "updated_at": "2020-07-09T12:39:35.129Z"
}]
```

## Adding Users to Organizations

To add a user to an organization, use the  `organizations collaborators set` command. This will add user `user1` as a collaborator of organization `org1` with all organization rights:

```bash
$ ttn-lw-cli organizations collaborators set --organization-id org1 --user-id user1 --right-organization-all
```

{{< note >}} You must specify rights when adding a collaborator. Use the `--help` flag to see the list of possible rights, e.g `$ ttn-lw-cli organizations collaborators set --help`. {{</ note >}}

## Removing Users from Organizations

To remove a user from an organization, use the  `organizations collaborators delete` command:

```bash
$ ttn-lw-cli organizations collaborators delete --organization-id org1 --user-id user1
```

This will remove user `user1` as a collaborator of organization `org1`

## Deleting Organizations

To delete an organization, use the `organizations delete` command.

```bash
$ ttn-lw-cli organizations delete --organization-id org1
```

{{< warning >}} When deleting organizations, their IDs stay reserved in the system. For security reasons, it is not possible to create a new organization with the same ID. {{</ warning >}}
