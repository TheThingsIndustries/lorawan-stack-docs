## What is {{% tts %}}

First off, it's a good idea to understand what {{% tts %}} is. Learn that, and lots more acronyms in the [What is {{% tts %}} section]({{< ref "getting-started/what-is-tts" >}}).

## LoRaWAN

In case you skipped the previous section, here is a quick summary: {{% tts %}} is a network server which implements the LoRaWAN protocol. To learn more about LoRaWAN, check out the [Learn section](https://thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan) of The Things Network, or read up at the [LoRa Alliance](https://lora-alliance.org).

Here is a video of Johan Stokking, the tech lead of The Things Industries and one of the core developers of {{% tts %}}, explaining LoRaWAN:

{{< note >}} Some common [use cases](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/what-is-lorawan/#lorawan-use-cases) are explained in the video above, but there are certain limitations that make LoRaWAN not suitable for every use-case. Read about [LoRaWAN limitations in The Things Network LoRaWAN documentation](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/limitations/). {{</ note >}}

Make sure to get familiar about [LoRaWAN architecture](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/architecture/) and [components]({{< ref "/reference/components" >}}), to understand how {{% tts %}} works.

## Start Using {{% tts %}}

To get started with {{% tts %}}, you can simply [create an account](https://console.cloud.thethings.network) on The Things Network to start using [The Things Stack Community Edition]({{< ref "getting-started/ttn" >}}) for free.

To purchase a professional plan for {{% tts %}}, see [Pricing](https://accounts.thethingsindustries.com/fee-calculator).

If you are more of the DIY type, you can also [install and run your own network server]({{< ref "getting-started/installation" >}}), using our [open source stack](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack).

## Build LoRaWAN Solutions

Once you have access to {{% tts %}}, it's time to start connecting devices. See the [Adding Devices section]({{< ref "devices/adding-devices" >}}) for instructions, or watch the video below for a complete introduction.

If you're using The Things Stack Community in an urban area, you may already have gateway coverage thanks to other members of the public The Things Network community. See [The Things Network Coverage Map](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/map) to find out.

If you're not covered, or you want to add gateways to extend the coverage of your network, see the [Adding Gateways section]({{< ref "gateways/adding-gateways" >}}).

Once you've added a device and it's connected to a gateway and to {{% tts %}}, see the [Integrations section]({{< ref "integrations" >}}) to learn how to connect other services to act on device data.
