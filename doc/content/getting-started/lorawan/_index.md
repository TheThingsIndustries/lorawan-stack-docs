{{< note >}} Some common [use cases](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/what-is-lorawan/#lorawan-use-cases) are explained in the video above, but there are certain limitations that make LoRaWAN not suitable for every use-case. Read about [LoRaWAN limitations in The Things Network LoRaWAN documentation](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/limitations/). {{</ note >}}

Make sure to get familiar about [LoRaWAN architecture](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/architecture/) and [components]({{< ref "/reference/components" >}}), to understand how {{% tts %}} works.

TODO: Summarise this anyway.
