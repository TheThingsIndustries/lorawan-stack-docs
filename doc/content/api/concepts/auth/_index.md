{{% tts %}} supports authentication using API keys, OAuth access tokens and Session cookies.

<!--more-->

{{% tts %}} **API keys** are the most commonly used method to authenticate and authorize API calls. This guide shows you how to create API keys, assign rights to them and use them to authenticate API calls. For OAuth access tokens and Session cookies, check the specific guides at the end of this page.

## What are API Keys

{{% tts %}} API keys are strings that have three parts separated by a dot (`.`). The format of an API key is shown below.

```
<token-type>.<token-id>.<token-secret>
```

<div class="fixed-table table-auth-key">

| Item           | Length | Value                                              |
| -------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `token-type`   | 5      | Fixed to `NNSXS` ("key" as base32 encoded string ) |
| `token-id`     | 39     | Unique identifier of the key, randomly generated   |
| `token-secret` | 52     | The secret value of they key, randomly generated   |

</div>

An example API Key is as follows

```
NNSXS.U4H3ZFFCMSR42BUAZPW2UWGFBV4WCNI5EXDJXDY.SHIF3PP5PBMJNZESN5XLR5TZJTJUIGKVUTM2I22IVBUVCD6VIQIA
```

{{< note "Please be careful not to expose your token secrets. Always redact the `token-secret` part of your token when publicly posting examples, screenshots etc." />}}

API Keys _by default do not have_ an expiry date. These have to be set explicitly while creating or updating them. API keys can be revoked by _simply deleting them_.

## Authorization

Authentication is the process of verifying the _identity_ of the caller. If the caller provides a valid, non-expired API key, the caller is authenticated.

Authorization on the other hand, is the process of determining if the authenticated caller has the _necessary rights_ to perform the requested action. {{% tts %}} handles authorization using Rights. Each API key is assigned a set of rights and {{% tts %}} checks this against the API call being made. For example, if the API call is to update a user but the API key only has rights to read users, then this call will be rejected.

For a full list of available rights, check the [reference]({{< ref "/api/reference/grpc/user" >}}).

## Creating User API Keys

API keys have other purposes such as authenticating gateways when they connect to {{% tts %}} or authenticating external integrations to send downlinks to devices.

In this section we explain how to create a _user API key_, which can be used to authenticate API calls on behalf of the user. API keys can be created either using the Console or the CLI. Choose the method that you prefer below.

{{< tabs/container "Console" "CLI" >}}

{{< tabs/tab "Console" >}}

In the **User settings** dropdown on the left-hand sidebar, select the **API Keys** option and select **+ Add API Key**.

{{< figure src="personal-api-keys.png" alt="Personal API key" >}}

Choose an optional expiry date and choose the required rights.
{{< figure src="application-rights.png" alt="Selectable rights" >}}

You can also choose **Grant all current and future rights** to this API key. Note that this gives the API Key all the access that your user has.

{{< figure src="rights-all.png" alt="All rights" >}}

Now make sure to copy this API key as you will not be able to retrieve it again.

{{< figure src="copy-api-key.png" alt="Copy API key" >}}

{{< /tabs/tab >}}

{{< tabs/tab "CLI" >}}

To create a user API key from the Command Line Interface, run the following command.

```bash
API_KEY_NAME="User API Key"
ttn-lw-cli users api-keys create \
  --name $API_KEY_NAME \
  --user-id $USER_ID \
  --right-user-all \
  --api-key-expiry 2023-11-23T00:00:00Z
```

The CLI will return the following JSON.

```json
{
  "id": "ZXPW62GWUYNYJIERJDHBIECRJEKYYDMACPPBEUI",
  "key": "NNSXS.ZXPW62GWUYNYJIERJDHBIECRJEKYYDMACPPBEUI.LQD7A5VGEXNZ7F7PNTVUPMPDEB5XBJMTIH6ESUEE622VU2FQVESA",
  "rights": ["RIGHT_USER_ALL"],
  "created_at": "2023-11-22T15:50:02.883333Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-11-22T15:50:02.883334Z"
}
```

Now make sure to copy this API key as you will not be able to retrieve it again.

## Using API Keys

This sections shows how you can use API keys to authenticate HTTP (REST) API calls. For other APIs (gRPC, MQTT), check the corresponding sections.

For HTTP (REST) API calls, this API key has to be presented to the server as a `Bearer` token in the HTTP `Authorization` header. The following example uses [curl](https://curl.se/) to make an HTTP API request using the example API key.

```bash
$ curl -X 'GET' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer NNSXS.U4H3ZFFCMSR42BUAZPW2UWGFBV4WCNI5EXDJXDY.SHIF3PP5PBMJNZESN5XLR5TZJTJUIGKVUTM2I22IVBUVCD6VIQIA' 'https://thethings.example.com/api/v3/applications/<application_id>/devices/<device_id>'
```

If you are using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to make API calls, in the **Authorization** tab select **Bearer Token** as the **Type** and paste the API key in the text field on the right.

Now that you have learnt about API keys, you can proceed to the [field masks]({{< ref "/api/concepts/fieldmasks" >}}) section.

Alternatively, look at how to work with OAuth access tokens and Session cookies in the guides below.
