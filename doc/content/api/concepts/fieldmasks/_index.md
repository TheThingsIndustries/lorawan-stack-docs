{{% tts %}} APIs use field masks (on supported APIs) to specify a subset of fields that should be returned by a reading request, or updated in a writing request.

<!--more-->

These requests support a `field_mask` field for selecting fields to operate on. By default, these API requests will not return or update most fields, unless they are specified in a field mask.

The following fields are **always returned**:

- Fields containing `id`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`
- `deleted_at`

All other fields are **not returned** and **not updated**, unless specified. Fields that are empty or zero are not returned, even if they are specified in a field mask.

{{< note "{{% tts %}} field masks are based on Google's [Protocol Buffers reference](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.FieldMask). Note that Google's Protocol Buffers return **all** available fields if no field mask is specified, but {{% tts %}} API does **not** work this way, and no fields except the above mentioned are returned if no field mask is specified." />}}

## Fields and Field Masks in HTTP (REST) Queries

This section explains how field masks are used in HTTP (REST) Queries. For other APIs (ex: gRPC), check the individual sections.

{{< tabs/container "GET" "PUT" "POST" >}}

{{< tabs/tab "GET" >}}

HTTP `GET` requests are used to fetch resources.

Fields may be specified in HTTP `GET` requests by appending them as query string parameters. For example, to request the `name`, `description`, and `locations` of devices in an [`EndDeviceRegistry.Get`]({{< ref "/api/reference/grpc/end_device#the-enddeviceregistry-service" >}}) request, add these fields to the `field_mask` field. To get this data for device `dev1` in application `app1`:

```bash
curl --location --header "Authorization: Bearer NNSXS.XXXXXXXXX" "https://thethings.example.com/api/v3/applications/app1/devices/dev1?field_mask=name,description,locations"
```

This will return the following:

 <details><summary>Show JSON API response</summary>

```
{
   "ids":{
      "device_id":"dev1",
      "application_ids":{
         "application_id":"app1"
      },
      "dev_eui":"46CF72F61862CBB0",
      "join_eui":"66209794D18AE087"
   },
   "created_at":"2020-07-31T12:17:51.645Z",
   "updated_at":"2021-07-20T14:14:56.318Z",
   "name":"device-name",
   "description":"device-description",
   "locations":{
      "user":{
         "latitude":52.51622086393074,
         "longitude":13.39075966780985,
         "source":"SOURCE_REGISTRY"
      }
   }
}
```

</details>

Without the field masks specified, this request would not return the `name`, `description`, and `locations` fields:

<details><summary>Show JSON API response</summary>

```
{
   "ids":{
      "device_id":"ben-things-uno",
      "application_ids":{
         "application_id":"tti-playground"
      },
      "dev_eui":"46CF72F61862CBB0",
      "join_eui":"66209794D18AE087"
   },
   "created_at":"2020-07-31T12:17:51.645Z",
   "updated_at":"2020-07-31T12:17:51.645Z"
}
```

{{< /tabs/tab >}}

{{< tabs/tab "PUT" >}}

`PUT` requests can be used to update entities by supplying the object as JSON data.

{{< note >}} Keep in mind that application ID (`application_ids.application_id`), end device ID (`device_id`), AppEUI/JoinEUI (`join_eui`), DevEUI (`dev_eui`) and API key IDs cannot be updated after creation. These fields are part of the allowed field mask, but they can only be used at creation, after which they can no longer be changed.

For example, to properly register an end device in {{% tts %}} like described in the [devices]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/manual" >}}) section, it is necessary to set the `dev_eui` field to device's DevEUI. However, updating the DevEUI after device is created will not be possible, i.e. will fail with the `forbidden path(s) in field mask` error. {{</ note >}}

To update fields, the field mask must also be specified in the JSON object (query parameters do not work for `PUT` requests). The field mask has the following format:

```
{
  "field_mask": {
      "paths": [
        "ids.device_id",
        "name",
        "description"
      ]
    }
}
```

Where `ids.device_id`, `name`, and `description` are fields to be updated.

For example, to update the `name` field of device `dev1` in application `app1`with an [`EndDeviceRegistry.Update`]({{< ref "/api/reference/grpc/end_device#the-enddeviceregistry-service" >}}) request:

```bash
curl --location \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer NNSXS.XXXXXXXXX' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --request PUT \
  --data-raw '{
   "end_device":{
      "name":"device-name",
      "description":"device-description"
   },
    "field_mask": {
      "paths": [
        "name"
      ]
    }
  }' \
  'https://thethings.example.com/api/v3/applications/app1/devices/dev1'
```

This request will update the `name` field of the device, but will not update the `description` field because it is not specified in the `field_mask` object. The following will be returned as confirmation:

<details><summary>Show JSON API response</summary>

```
{
   "ids":{
      "device_id":"dev1",
      "application_ids":{
         "application_id":"app1"
      },
      "dev_eui":"46CF72F61862CBB0",
      "join_eui":"66209794D18AE087"
   },
   "created_at":"2020-07-31T12:17:51.645Z",
   "updated_at":"2021-07-20T15:04:26.339Z",
   "name":"device-name"
}
```

</details>

To update both the `name` and `description` fields, the following request could be made:

```bash
curl --location \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer NNSXS.XXXXXXXXX' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --request PUT \
  --data-raw '{
   "end_device":{
      "name":"device-name",
      "description":"device-description"
   },
    "field_mask": {
      "paths": [
        "name",
        "description",
      ]
    }
  }' \
  'https://thethings.example.com/api/v3/applications/app1/devices/dev1'
```

This would return the following confirmation:

<details><summary>Show JSON API response</summary>

```bash
{
   "ids":{
      "device_id":"dev1",
      "application_ids":{
         "application_id":"app1"
      },
      "dev_eui":"46CF72F61862CBB0",
      "join_eui":"66209794D18AE087"
   },
   "created_at":"2020-07-31T12:17:51.645Z",
   "updated_at":"2021-07-20T15:04:26.339Z",
   "name":"device-name",
   "description": "device-description",
}
```

</details>
{{< /tabs/tab >}}

{{< tabs/tab "POST" >}}

Some endpoints require a message to be sent as part of the request. For example, to request an [Event Stream]({{< ref "/api/reference/grpc/events#the-event-service" >}}), you must `POST` a [StreamEventsRequest message]({{< ref "/api/reference/grpc/events#message:StreamEventsRequest" >}}):

```bash
curl --location \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer NNSXS.XXXXXXXXX' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --request POST \
  --data-raw '{
    "identifiers":[{
        "device_ids":{
            "device_id":"dev1",
            "application_ids":{"application_id":"app1"}
        }
    }]
  }' \
  'https://thethings.example.com/api/v3/events'
```
